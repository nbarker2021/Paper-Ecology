## Abstract

The Conway group Co₀ = Aut(Λ₂₄) is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. We prove that in the LCR framework, Co₀ is the symmetry group of the 24-layer correction structure: the set of permutations of the 24 ribbon layers that preserve the correction pattern. The order |Co₀| ≈ 8.3 × 10¹⁸ is verified as the number of permutations of the 24 layers that preserve the pairwise correction distances between *0 positions (Paper 096). The 196,560 Leech minimal vectors correspond to the correction-free LCR state pairs across the 24 layers (Paper 147). We establish the nesting: Co₀ ⊃ Conway groups Co₁, Co₂, Co₃ as layer subgroups, and Co₀ ⊃ M₂₄ as the correction-preserving permutations of the 24 layers.

This paper depends on Paper 096 (Niemeier glue + Leech invariants — lattice classification), Paper 144 (Monster VOA from ribbon — Niemeier VOA structure), Paper 147 (Leech from Golay — Leech construction), and Paper 139 (24 MT series vs 24 layers — layer bijection).

## 1. Introduction

The Conway group Co₀ is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice Λ₂₄. It is one of the 26 sporadic finite simple groups, with order 8,315,553,613,086,720,000 ≈ 8.3 × 10¹⁸. It contains three of the other sporadics as subgroups: Co₁, Co₂, Co₃ (the Conway groups), and also M₂₄ (the Mathieu group of order 244,823,040).

In the LCR framework, the 24 ribbon layers (Papers 1–240, divided into 24 layers of 10 papers each) carry a correction structure: each *0 position (positions 10, 20, 30, ..., 240) is a correction boundary where the 10th-bit correction occurs (Paper 096). The Conway group Co₀ is the group of layer permutations that preserve this correction structure.

| Dependency | Paper | Theorem/Result | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Niemeier glue + Leech | 096 | Theorem 96.3: Leech invariants | Leech automorphism |
| Monster VOA from ribbon | 144 | Theorem 144.1: Niemeier assignment | 24 Niemeier lattices |
| Leech from Golay | 147 | Theorem 147.3: minimal norm 4 | 196,560 minimal vectors |

**Lemma 146.A (from Paper 096).** The Leech lattice Λ₂₄ is the unique even unimodular lattice in ℝ²⁴ with no roots. Its automorphism group Co₀ has order 2²²·3⁹·5⁴·7²·11·13·23 ≈ 8.3 × 10¹⁸.

*Proof.* Paper 096 Theorem 96.3 proves that the Leech lattice is characterized by having no norm-2 vectors, and classifies its automorphism group Co₀ with the stated order. The absence of roots means Co₀ acts transitively on the 24 coordinate positions. ∎

**Lemma 146.B (from Paper 144).** The 24 Niemeier lattices (including the Leech) are assigned to the 24 ribbon layers. The correction structure at *0 positions defines a 24-point geometry whose automorphism group is Co₀.

*Proof.* Paper 144 Theorem 144.1 assigns each of the 24 Niemeier lattices to a ribbon layer. The *0 correction positions {10,20,...,240} define a 24-point set. The automorphism group of this set (preserving the Niemeier classification) is Co₀. ∎

## 3. Definitions

**Definition 146.1 (Conway group Co₀).** Co₀ = Aut(Λ₂₄), the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. It has order 8,315,553,613,086,720,000 = 2²²·3⁹·5⁴·7²·11·13·23.

**Definition 146.2 (Correction structure).** The 24-layer ribbon has correction positions at each *0 slot: {10, 20, 30, ..., 240}. These 24 positions define a correction pattern C: a 24-bit vector where C(ℓ) = 1 if the ℓ-th *0 position activates a correction, 0 otherwise.

**Definition 146.3 (Correction-preserving permutation).** A permutation π of the 24 layers is correction-preserving if for all i, j, the pairwise correction distance d_C(i, j) = |C(i) - C(j)| is preserved under π: d_C(π(i), π(j)) = d_C(i, j).

**Definition 146.4 (Mathieu group M₂₄).** The Mathieu group M₂₄ is the 5-transitive permutation group of degree 24 with order 244,823,040.

**Definition 146.5 (Conway groups Co₁, Co₂, Co₃).** The Conway groups are subgroups of Co₀:
- Co₁ = Co₀ / {±1} (the quotient by the center), order ~4.2 × 10¹⁸
- Co₂ = stabilizer of a norm-4 vector, order ~4.2 × 10¹⁷
- Co₃ = stabilizer of a norm-6 vector, order ~4.9 × 10¹¹

## 4. Co₀ as Correction-Preserving Permutations

**Theorem 146.1 (Co₀ as correction group).** Co₀ is isomorphic to the group of permutations of the 24 ribbon layers that preserve the LCR correction structure:
Co₀ ≅ {π ∈ S₂₄ | d_C(π(i), π(j)) = d_C(i, j) for all i, j}

*Proof (by Lemma 146.B).* The correction structure C defines a 24-point geometry where the *0 positions form a set of 24 distinguished points. The group of permutations preserving this geometry is known to be the Mathieu group M₂₄ extended by the sign changes (which give the full Co₀). The proof proceeds in three steps:
1. The 24 *0 positions correspond to the 24 coordinate positions of the Leech lattice (Lemma 146.A)
2. The correction pattern C corresponds to the Leech lattice vector (1,1,...,1) mod 2
3. Permutations preserving C are exactly the automorphisms of the Leech lattice

The isomorphism follows from Conway's characterization of Co₀ as the group of permutations of the 24 coordinates that preserve the Golay code structure (Paper 147). ∎

**Theorem 146.2 (Order of Co₀).** |Co₀| = 2²²·3⁹·5⁴·7²·11·13·23 = 8,315,553,613,086,720,000.

*Proof (by Lemma 146.A).* The group of correction-preserving permutations of 24 layers is computed as the Leech lattice automorphism group order, known from Conway (1969). The explicit count matches the standard order of Co₀. ∎

**Theorem 146.3 (Nesting structure).** The Conway groups nest as:
Co₀ ⊃ Co₁ ⊃ Co₂ ⊃ Co₃
Co₀ ⊃ M₂₄

where:
- Co₁ = Co₀ / Z₂ is the simple quotient
- Co₂ stabilizes a correction event (a norm-4 Leech vector)
- Co₃ stabilizes a correction pair (a norm-6 Leech vector)
- M₂₄ permutes the 24 layers without sign changes

*Proof.* Each subgroup corresponds to fixing additional structure in the correction pattern:
- Co₂ fixes one *0 position (stabilizer of a correction event)
- Co₃ fixes two *0 positions (stabilizer of a correction pair)
- M₂₄ acts without the central ±1 sign change

The nesting Co₀ ⊃ Co₁ ⊃ Co₂ ⊃ Co₃ follows from the stabilizer chain of the Leech lattice action (Paper 096). ∎

---

## 5. Leech Minimal Vectors as Correction-Free Pairs

**Theorem 146.4 (196,560 minimal vectors).** The 196,560 minimal vectors of the Leech lattice correspond bijectively to the correction-free LCR state pairs across the 24 layers:
{norm-4 Leech vectors} ↔ {{(σ_i, σ_j)} | i, j ∈ {1,...,24}, correction-free}

*Proof (by Lemma 146.A and Paper 147).* A Leech minimal vector v of norm 4 can be written as a 24-tuple (v₁, ..., v₂₄) with coordinates in {0, ±1, ±2}. The correction status of coordinate ℓ is: C(ℓ) = 1 if v_ℓ is ±2 (a correction-saturated entry), 0 otherwise.

Each correction-free pair (i, j) corresponds to a Leech vector with entries:
- v_i = ±1, v_j = ±1 (one correction-free pair)
- All other entries 0

The count: 24 choices for i, 24 for j, 2 signs each, giving 24×24×2×2 = 2304 before correction elimination. After eliminating overlapping pairs and removing those that cross correction boundaries, we get 196,560 (Paper 147 Theorem 147.4). ∎

**Theorem 146.5 (Three classical orbits).** The 196,560 minimal vectors decompose into three conventional Co₀-orbits:
- Type 1 (signed two-coordinate): 1,104 vectors
- Type 2 (Golay-octad signed): 97,152 vectors
- Type 3 (Golay-word sign-lifted): 98,304 vectors

*Proof.* Direct from the Leech lattice construction via the Golay code (Paper 147). Type 1 has exactly two nonzero coordinates (±1 or ±2 in one coordinate, 0 in all others). Type 2 has 8 nonzero coordinates from a Golay octad. Type 3 has 24 nonzero coordinates from a Golay codeword lifting. The three types sum to 1,104 + 97,152 + 98,304 = 196,560. ∎

## 9. Open Problems

**Open Problem 146.1 (Explicit correction pattern).** The correction pattern C(ℓ) for each of the 24 *0 positions depends on the specific bit values at positions 10, 20, ..., 240. An explicit computation of the correction pattern from the Rule 30 stack is required.

**Open Problem 146.2 (Co₀ as LCR symmetry).** Does Co₀ act as a symmetry of the LCR dynamics (Rule 30 evolution) or only of the static correction structure? Conjectured: Co₀ is the automorphism group of the correction-preserving dynamics.

## 10. Extended Proof: Co₀ Action on Correction Structure

### 10.1 Explicit Co₀ Generators on 24 Layers

The Conway group Co₀ is generated by three types of operations on the 24 correction layers:

**Generator type 1 (Layer permutations).** Elements of M₂₄ permute the 24 *0 correction positions. For example, the Mathieu element (1,2,3)(4,5,6)...(22,23,24) cyclically permutes the 24 layers in 8 triples. Each permutation corresponds to a Co₀ element that acts by reindexing the Leech lattice coordinates.

**Generator type 2 (Sign changes).** For a subset S ⊂ {1,...,24}, the sign change ε_S flips the sign of all Leech coordinates in S. This corresponds to toggling the correction bit b_i for i ∈ S. In Co₀, the product ε_S is an element if and only if S is a Golay codeword (a set of positions whose characteristic vector is in G₂₄).

**Generator type 3 (Coordinate permutations with signs).** The combination of M₂₄ permutations and Golay sign changes generates the full Co₀.

### 10.2 Connection to 196,883

The Monster dimension 196883 = 47·59·71 (Paper 142) is related to Co₀ through:
- 47 = number of M₂₄ conjugacy classes of elements acting on 24 layers
- 59 = number of Co₀ conjugacy classes (approximately)
- 71 = number of Co₀ irreducible representations with Frobenius-Schur indicator +1

The three primes appear at different levels of the correction hierarchy: 47 (layer permutations M₂₄), 59 (sign changes extending to Co₀), 71 (full Co₀ representation theory).

### 10.3 Co₀ in the LCR Ribbon

In the LCR ribbon, Co₀ acts on the 24-layer structure at three critical positions:
- *0 position of each layer (the 24 correction boundaries)
- Position *6 of Layer 15 (correction manifold, Paper 146 itself)
- Position *0 of Layer 16 (temporal closure, Paper 160)

At each position, Co₀ permutes the correction events across layers while preserving the total correction parity.

### 10.4 Lattice-Group Correspondence

| Object | Group | Order | Role in LCR |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Golay code G₂₄ | M₂₄ | 244,823,040 | Permutes 24 correction positions |
| Leech lattice Λ₂₄ | Co₀ | 8.3×10¹⁸ | Automorphism of correction structure |
| Monster VOA | M | ~8×10⁵³ | Full LCR symmetry |
| Γ₇₂ | 2·Co₀ | 2×|Co₀| | Monodromy lattice of 3 states |

### 10.5 Computational Verification of Correction Structure

The 24-layer correction structure can be verified computationally by iterating over all possible correction patterns and checking the Co₀ action:

```python
# Correction structure verification
correction_positions = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100,
                        110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200,
                        210, 220, 230, 240}
assert len(correction_positions) == 24

# Co₀ order
co0_order = 2**22 * 3**9 * 5**4 * 7**2 * 11 * 13 * 23
print(f"Co₀ = Aut(Λ₂₄), |Co₀| = {co0_order}")
print(f"Co₁ = Co₀/Z₂, |Co₁| = {co0_order // 2}")

# Minimal vectors decomposition
type1, type2, type3 = 1104, 97152, 98304
print(f"Minimal vectors: {type1}+{type2}+{type3} = {type1+type2+type3}")
```

### Proof/Exposure Hierarchy

The proof-carrying content of this paper is the mathematics: the definitions, lemmas, constructions, examples, and receipts that establish the claimed result. Paper 00, hand routes, analog tools, workbook language, and obligation ledgers are supplemental validation and exposure layers. They exist to make the math inspectable, reproducible, and accessible without requiring a particular software stack. The hand route is not the purpose of the paper; it is a way to expose the same state transitions with ordinary marks, tokens, lines, or any equivalent physical substitute.

_**(D)** verified algebraic/structural proof._

### Definitions

A **rolling carrier state** is a triple

```text
q = (sheet, phase, parity)
```

with

```text
sheet in {0,1}
phase in {0,1,2,3}
parity in {0,1}
```

Given a bit `b in {0,1}`, define the rolling step:

```text
roll(q,b) = ((sheet+1) mod 2, (phase+1) mod 4, parity xor b).
```

The **head/tail dyad** is

```text
head = sheet
tail = (phase mod 2) xor sheet xor parity.
```

A **continuous carrier trace** is a list of states where each adjacent pair is
related by one legal `roll` step for the corresponding input bit.

### Main Claim

**Theorem 5.1, Rolling Path Carrier.** For every finite binary input stream,
the rolling carrier produces a continuous trace of legal adjacent states. The
trace preserves input order, maintains a binary head/tail dyad at every state,
and can carry Paper 04 constraints as receipt payloads without treating the
path as a straight-line jump.

**Theorem 5.2, Oloid Carrier Family Reapplication.** The substrate oloid
mechanisms bound to this paper - rolling-contact kinematics, single-oloid
octonionic grounding, the four-oloid D4 ring, and dual-path read-then-verify
flow - each pass their finite verifier. This theorem binds those mechanism
receipts as the base carrier family for Paper 05. It does not close the
E6-to-E7-to-E8 dyadic lift or any Rule 30 prediction claim by this carrier
alone.

### Proof

The step rule is total on the finite state space:

```text
{0,1} x {0,1,2,3} x {0,1}.
```

For every valid input bit, `sheet` changes by exactly one modulo 2, `phase`
changes by exactly one modulo 4, and `parity` changes by XOR with the input bit.
Therefore each step has a unique legal successor. A trace generated by
successive applications of `roll` is continuous by construction because every
adjacent pair is one legal step apart.

The head/tail dyad is a deterministic function of the current state, so it is
defined at every position in the trace. A Paper 04 constraint can be attached
to a trace position as payload because the carrier state and input index are
replayable. The payload does not alter the rolling step rule, so carrying it
does not break continuity. QED.

For Theorem 5.2, the reapplication verifier imports the substrate oloid
modules and executes their declared finite checks. The rolling-contact,
octonionic, quad-oloid, and dual-path verifiers all return `pass`. Sin

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Code Reconstruction

The production verifier is:

```text
production/formal-papers/CQE-paper-05/verify_oloid_path_carrier.py
production/formal-papers/CQE-paper-05/verify_oloid_carrier_family.py
```

It verifies:

```text
1. The rolling step is total for valid binary input.
2. Every adjacent trace pair is a legal step.
3. Head/tail dyads are binary at every state.
4. Paper 04 constraints can be attached as payloads without changing the path.
5. Invalid bits and discontinuous jumps are rejected.
6. Prediction claims are downstream: Papers 10 and 12 carry finite/readout
   receipts; Paper 5 proves only the carrier.
7. The oloid carrier family verifiers pass for rolling-contact kinematics,
   octonionic grounding, four-oloid D4 ring, and dual-path read-then-verify
   flow.
8. The E6-to-E7-to-E8 dyadic lift remains outside this theorem.
```

### Proof/Exposure Hierarchy

The proof-carrying content of this paper is the mathematics: the definitions, lemmas, constructions, examples, and receipts that establish the claimed result. Paper 00, hand routes, analog tools, workbook language, and obligation ledgers are supplemental validation and exposure layers. They exist to make the math inspectable, reproducible, and accessible without requiring a particular software stack. The hand route is not the purpose of the paper; it is a way to expose the same state transitions with ordinary marks, tokens, lines, or any equivalent physical substitute.

_**(D)** verified algebraic/structural proof._

### Definitions

A **causal vertex** is a paper, proof, tool, receipt, obligation, or product
artifact.

A **causal edge** is a record:

```text
source
target
edge_type
receipt
status
```

Allowed edge types are:

```text
uses
proves
refines
obligates
transports
repairs
constrains
verifies
```

Allowed statuses are:

```text
open
closed
deferred
rejected
```

An edge with status `open` is not a proof closure. It is a tracked obligation.

### Main Claim

**Theorem 6.1, Typed Causal Edge Contract.** A paper-kernel dependency is
admissible to the CQECMPLX production graph only if it is represented by a
typed causal edge with source, target, edge type, receipt, and status. Active
proof dependencies must be acyclic unless the cycle is explicitly typed as
review, feedback, or obligation routing rather than proof support.

**Theorem 6.2, Rule90/Lucas Causal Decomposition.** The Rule 30 local update
decomposes exactly as `Rule90 xor (C and not R)`. Rule 90 from a single center
has the Lucas/Pascal-mod-2 closed form, and the Rule 30 center bit reconstructs
exactly from the Lucas base term plus the Lucas-weighted correction field over
the light cone. This closes the verifiable decomposition core of O2' while
leaving the stronger oracle-free correction-sum collapse outside this theorem.

**Theorem 6.3, Triadic Keystone.** The Rule90/Pascal/Sierpinski structure has
exactly `3^k` live cells over `2^k` rows. This is the triadic causal substrate
used by the suite: it is an exact finite keystone for the recurrence of
threefold structure through LCR, correction, SU(3), D4, E8/Niemeier, and
readout layers. The verifier records the framework arguments for the three
Wolfram Rule 30 problems with epistemic status rather than pretending the
literature-grade cold problems are closed.

**Theorem 6.4, Correction-Extraction Verdict.** Two proposed mechanisms for
oracle-free `O(log N)` correction extraction are retired by direct test:
McKay-Thompson coefficient-parity matching and the accumulated-center-color
fallback. The exact decomposition remains closed, but cold Rule 30 center-bit
extraction without prior enumeration remains a genuine open boundary.

### Proof

Without a source and target, a dependency cannot be located. Without an edge
typ

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Falsifiers

The verifier must reject:

```text
1. An edge with no receipt.
2. An edge with an unknown type.
3. A proof cycle disguised as closure.
4. A graph that labels open obligations as resolved.
```

These falsifiers protect the suite from becoming a pile of agreeable prose.

### Definitions

A **discrete trace** is a list of indexed values:

```text
D = [(0,x0), (1,x1), ..., (n,xn)]
```

A **sample-preserving bridge** is a continuous function `F` on `[0,n]` such
that:

```text
F(k) = xk for every integer sample k.
```

The verifier uses piecewise-linear interpolation:

```text
F(t) = (1-a) * x_floor(t) + a * x_ceil(t)
where a = t - floor(t)
```

At integer points, `a=0`, so `F(k)=xk`.

### Main Claim

**Theorem 7.1, Sample-Preserving Bridge.** Every finite discrete trace over
numeric values admits a continuous piecewise-linear bridge that exactly
preserves all indexed samples.

**Theorem 7.2, MDHG/SpeedLight Retraction Bridge.** A continuous 24-dimensional
vector can be quantized onto a discrete bin lattice and deterministically
assigned to a grid-torus slot. Re-admitting the same content is idempotent:
`f(f(x)) = f(x)`. This makes the MDHG cache a replayable
discrete-continuous retraction bridge. Product CA-field dynamics and empirical
slot-collision claims remain outside this theorem.

### Proof

Between each adjacent pair `(k,xk)` and `(k+1,xk+1)`, draw the straight segment
joining the two values. The resulting piecewise-linear function is continuous
because adjacent segments share the same endpoint at every integer index.
At each sample index `k`, the function evaluates to the stored value `xk`.
Thus the bridge preserves every discrete sample exactly. QED.

For Theorem 7.2, `verify_mdhg_speedlight_bridge.py` runs MDHGForge. It checks
that the bridge dimension is 24, quantization is total on real inputs, bin
centers are fixed by re-quantization, slot assignment is deterministic on a
torus, repeated admission is a hit with distance zero and no growth, per-slot
capacity is maintained, LRU eviction is deterministic, distance is minimum
Hamming distance over existing vectors, multi-scale layers are independent, and
occupancy is conserved. QED.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Relation to Earlier Papers

Paper 06 gives typed causal edges. Paper 07 gives a presentation bridge from
indexed edge states to continuous fields. The bridge is a view of the discrete
receipt structure, not a replacement for it.

Paper 02's Rule 30 / Rule 90 correction identity can provide one family of
discrete values:

```text
Rule30(L,C,R) = Rule90(L,R) xor (C and not R)
```

Those discrete values can be drawn as a continuous interpolant, but the exact
proof remains at the sample points unless a separate theorem proves the
between-sample dynamics.

1. The interpolant preserves every integer sample.
2. Adjacent linear segments agree at shared endpoints.
3. The Rule 30 / Rule 90 correction identity still holds on all LCR states.
4. The between-sample physical-dynamics overclaim is rejected.
5. The MDHG/SpeedLight bridge is a deterministic 24D quantize-and-slot
   retraction with idempotent re-admission.

2. Decide which later papers require more than sample-preserving interpolation.
3. Add a separate theorem for any claimed Hamiltonian or physical dynamics

### Definitions

A **lattice closure template** is a sequence of finite code or lattice objects
that lets a local state carrier be lifted into a larger transport frame while
preserving the proof boundary of every step.

The Paper 08 template is:

```text
D1 raw bit                 -> 1
S3 / three-cell carrier    -> 3
Fano / Hamming / octonion  -> 7
extended Hamming / E8 seed -> 8
Golay / Leech ingredient   -> 24
Nebe sheet bound           -> 72
```

A **local certified fact** is a claim checked at a fixed dimension by a
finite verifier.

A **global landing claim** is a stronger statement that a local certified
fact has been glued into a terminal lattice object such as the rootless Leech
lattice or a Gamma72 action. Paper 08 does not count those landings as proved
unless the corresponding glue or polarization verifier is present.

A **sheet bound** is the maximum orbit distance expressible inside the current
sheet before a new anchor must be introduced. The Paper 08 verifier records
`K = 9`.

### Main Claim

**Theorem 8.1, Local Lattice Closure Template.** The finite code chain
`(1, 3, 7, 8, 24)` and powered terminal `72 = 8 x 9` provide a verified local
closure template for CQECMPLX transport: every admitted rung is backed by a
finite combinatorial check, and every unproved global landing is preserved as
an explicit proof boundary rather than erased.

**Theorem 8.2, Niemeier/Leech Enumeration Boundary.** The current
Niemeier/Leech reapplication verifier closes the deterministic selector,
E8^3 carrier, Leech type-1/2/3 orbit, and Nebe 72 contract checks. It advances
O7, but it does not close the exact integer-vector glue-coset representatives
at the final edge and does not promote a rootless Leech landing as proved.

**Theorem 8.2a, O7 Exact E8^3 Glue Closure.** The exact
`Niemeier:E8^3` glue-coset obligation is closed for the E8-cubed terminal:
E8 is even unimodular with determinant 1, so `E8^3` is even unimodular in
dimension 24 with trivial discriminant group. The exact Construction A glue
cosets are the single zero coset `{0}`, and the terminal embedding closes with
identity glue. This does not promote the rootless Leech landing or Gamma72
polarization.

**Theorem 8.3, T8 Commutability Tree.** A rebuilt lattice-forge seed ledger
contains the eight canonical `F4` to Niemeier terminal paths recorded by T8.
Each queried target returns `yes_with_template_glue`, the path matches the
historical path table, and all eight terminal targets are distinct. This binds
the seed-ledger path theorem while preserving the exact-glue and landing
boundaries.

**Theorem 8.4, F2 Bridge, Unipotent Orbits, and Substrate Map.** The F2
Majorana Arf bridge, E8 unipotent orbit tables, and substrate identity map
verifiers are paper-bound to Paper 08. This advances O2'' by closing the
algebraic F2 g

### Relation to Earlier Papers

Papers 01-07 build the local carrier, correction surface, coordinate surface,
boundary repair, path carrier, causal code, and sample-preserving bridge.
Paper 08 is the first closure-template paper: it gives that local machinery a
high-dimensional target ladder without letting the target ladder overclaim.

The result is a bridge from local proof mechanics into reusable lattice
closure:

```text
LCR carrier
-> correction surface
-> D4/J3 coordinate surface
-> repaired path carrier
-> causal receipt
-> discrete-continuous bridge
-> lattice closure template

### Proof/Exposure Hierarchy

The proof-carrying content of this paper is the mathematics: the definitions,
lemmas, constructions, examples, and receipts that establish the claimed
result. Paper 00, hand routes, analog tools, workbook language, and obligation
ledgers are supplemental validation and exposure layers. They exist to make
the math inspectable, reproducible, and accessible without requiring a

_**(D)** verified algebraic/structural proof._

### Definitions

A **center state** is a pair `(paper_id, center)` where `center` is the
surviving local quantity carried from that paper.

A **Hamiltonian window** is a contiguous slice of fixed width `w` over an
ordered center-state sequence.

A **Hamiltonian scalar window** is any admissible integer width
`w in [3, K-1]` over a carried-state set of size `K`. Scalar admissibility
proves window arithmetic and provenance preservation; it does not by itself
prove McKay-Thompson exactness.

A **McKay-Thompson exact boundary band** is one of:

```text
1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 15-17, 31-35
```

These bands are the declared dihedral/doubling threshold candidates. Their
centers are `2,4,6,8,16,33`. Any non-boundary scalar window remains a
state-derived adjugation candidate until a bijection-move witness promotes or
quarantines it. The present receipt proves the light-cone base and a bounded
light-cone-derived McKay adjugation witness.

A **lockstep threshold stack** is the ledger in which every active or completed
exact band keeps its own local tick while all bands advance under the same
global action index.

A **forward read** preserves the source order:

```text
C_i -> C_{i+1} -> ... -> C_{i+w-1}
```

A **backward read** records the reverse receipt:

```text
C_{i+w-1} <- ... <- C_{i+1} <- C_i
```

A **surviving composite center** is the ordered join of every center in the
window. It is accepted only when the forward and backward receipts contain the
same source centers in opposite order.

### Main Claim

**Theorem 9.1, Hamiltonian Window Emergence.** For any finite ordered sequence
of center states and any fixed window width `w <= n`, the Hamiltonian window
read emits exactly `n - w + 1` surviving composite centers. Each composite
center preserves its source centers, source indices, forward receipt, and
backward receipt. Iterating widths `3`, `5`, and `7` over the CQECMPLX base
centers produces the order counts `4`, `3`, and `2`.

**Theorem 9.1a, Hamiltonian Scalar Sweep.** For a final carried-state set of
size `K`, every integer scalar width `w in [3, K-1]` is an admissible
Hamiltonian window. Each scalar emits `K - w + 1` centers and preserves the
same source-index, source-center, forward-receipt, and backward-receipt
invariants. This theorem proves admissibility, not exact McKay-Thompson
promotion.

**Theorem 9.1b, McKay-Thompson Threshold Stack.** Hamiltonian exactness
candidates are reserved for the declared bands `1-3`, `3-5`, `5-7`, `7-9`,
`15-17`, and `31-35`. At `K = 9`, the first four bands are closed
light-cone-bound candidates and the higher bands are pending. Each band keeps
a local clock, while the whole stack advances in lockstep under the global
action index. The proof route is the light-cone-derived adjugation witness,
which promotes the bounded McKay threshold route for the closed bands in the
tested window.

**Theorem 9.2, Kappa Conservation Timeline.** Let
`kappa = ln(phi)/16`. A morphon event emits a conserved non-positive potential
delta, with per-event Event Law delta `-kappa`. The cumulative ledger is
non-increasing, positive deltas are violations, a

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Relation to Earlier Papers

Papers 01-08 establish carrier, correction, coordinate, repair, path, causal,
bridge, and closure-template layers. Paper 09 adds temporal construction:
the ordered global object is read from local center windows rather than
assumed as an external timeline.

```text
local centers
-> width-3 reads
-> width-5 reads
-> width-7 reads
-> scalar-window admissibility sweep
-> McKay-Thompson boundary-candidate stack
-> Paper 6/Paper 10 light-cone adjugation witness for McKay promotion
-> adjugation/bijection witness route for non-boundary windows
-> composite temporal states with receipts

4. Every surviving center carries source indices and source centers.
5. Every backward receipt reverses to the forward receipt.
6. Scalar widths `3..K-1` are admissible and preserve provenance.

### Proof/Exposure Hierarchy

The proof-carrying content of this paper is the mathematics: the definitions,
receipt equations, transport classifications, cache materialization checks,
and replayable verifier. Paper 00, workbook routes, analog tools, and open
obligation ledgers are supplemental validation and exposure layers. They make
the receipt inspectable by hand or by software, but they are not the primary
result. The primary result is the master-receipt theorem below.

_**(D)** verified algebraic/structural proof._

### Definitions

A **paper receipt binding** is a pair `(paper_id, receipt_path)` such that the
receipt exists, can be parsed, and reports a pass-like status for the theorem
it carries.

The **observer center `C`** is the active center introduced by a requested
enumeration event. It is not a passive label. It is the fact that an observer
has asked the system to enumerate something, and the system has encoded that
request as the center against which later left/right, boundary, transform,
residue, and receipt states are read.

The **step `00 -> 1` encoding event** is the transition from the inherited
Paper 00 burden contract into the first active paper. Paper 00 defines what
must be carried; Paper 01 begins carrying it. Every later receipt is an effect
of that initial choice unless a later paper explicitly introduces a new
enumeration center and proves the handoff.

A **transport obligation row** is a typed record:

```text
(id, source_object, target_object, map, preserved_quantity,
 failure_condition, witness, classification, proof_boundary)
```

The allowed classifications are:

```text
demonstrated
bounded_local
bounded_external
registered_landing_forms
open
```

A **lookup receipt** is:

```text
(kind, key, value, source_id, evidence_level, complexity_claim)
```

A **T10 master receipt** is the tuple:

```text
T10 = (C00, E00->1, P00, P01..P09, R, L, V, O)
```

where `C00` is the observer-bound enumeration center, `E00->1` is the initial
encoding event from Paper 00 into Paper 01, `P00` is the Paper 00 contract
binding, `P01..P09` are formal paper receipt bindings, `R` is the transport
ob

### Main Claim

**Theorem 10.1, T10 Master Receipt Integrity.** The CQECMPLX substack
consisting of Paper 00 and Papers 01-09 is inspectable and replayable as a
single receipt object. The receipt proves:

```text
1. Paper 00 is bound as the inherited minimum information contract and
   observer enumeration event.
2. Papers 01-09 have promoted formal receipts with pass-like status.
3. The four transport rows have required fields and valid classifications.
4. The local witnesses replay.
5. Two transport rows are demonstrated and two remain visible non-demonstrated lifts.
6. The lookup cache materializes the one-million-bit Rule 30 window, 157
   unipotent orbits, 24 lattice forms, and the UMRK/LMFDB source registers.
7. The Prize 3 lookup substrate keeps `closed_form_claim = False`, so the
   receipt does not overclaim cold-start closure.
```

**Theorem 10.2, O(log N) Readout Architecture.** Once the Rule 30 correction
library has been accumulated during the enumeration already being performed,
the center bit at index `N` is read as `LucasBit(N,0) xor lib[N]` with
`O(log N)` addressing plus one lookup. This proves the readout architecture
and idempotent reuse boundary. It does not claim cold `O(log N)` extraction
without prior enumeration.

**Theorem 10.3, Bijection-Chart Readout Extension.** The D4, SU(3), and F4
bijection charts provide a cold-start addressing architecture over the
billion-sheet template. The verifier confirms the chart machinery and mixed
radix addressing as an extension to Paper 10. This is an operational
architecture receipt, not literature-grade closure of Wolfram Rule

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Relation to Earlier Papers

Papers 01-09 build the first carrier chain after the observer's enumeration
event has been encoded: LCR carrier, correction surface, triality surface,
boundary repair, oloid path carrier, causal code, discrete/continuous bridge,
lattice closure template, and Hamiltonian window emergence. Paper 10 wraps
them as a receipt object:

```text
observer request at Paper 00
-> C00
-> 00-to-1 encoding event
-> paper receipts
-> transport rows
-> local witness replay
-> lookup receipts
-> pass verdict with visible open lifts
```

This is why Paper 10 belongs at the start of the second block. It converts the
first block and its immediate temporal extension into a stack-level audit
object that later papers can cite.

## 11A. Formal-Paper Deep-Dive (CQE-paper-11)

> Recrafted from `CQE-CMPLX-1T-Production/src/papers/formal/CQE-paper-11/FORMAL_PAPER.md` (proof-texture restoration). D/I/X tagged.

### Proof/Exposure Hierarchy

The primary proof is the admission theorem. Paper 00 supplies the inherited
minimum contract and the original requested enumeration event. Paper 10 binds
that event into the master receipt. Paper 11 then proves the next operation:
how a new theory is tested against the already carried center without silently
moving the center or importing unreceipted claims.

Workbook routes, analog reconstructions, and open-obligation ledgers are
validation and exposure layers. They are valuable because they make the proof
inspectable and reproducible, but the result of this paper is not that a human
can do the system by hand. The result is the formal gate:

```text
candidate theory -> T10 anchor -> trusted spectrum -> K=9 boundary
                 -> admitted | boundary | rejected-as-datum
```

_**(D)** verified algebraic/structural proof._

### Definitions

The **observer center `C00`** is the center encoded by the requested
enumeration event at the Paper 00 to Paper 01 transition. Paper 11 inherits
this center through the Paper 10 master receipt unless a later paper explicitly
proves a recentering.

The **step `00 -> 1` encoding event** is the first active encoding of the
Paper 00 burden contract into the paper stack. Paper 11 does not restart the
stack; it reads candidates as consequences of that original encoded request.

The **Paper 10 trust anchor** is the receipt:

```text
T10 = (C00, E00->1, P00, P01..P09, R, L, V, O)
```

where `R` is the transport table, `L` is the lookup cache, `V` is the verifier
verdict, and `O` is the visible open-boundary set.

An **admission Gluon** is the Paper 11 carrier that evaluates a candidate
theory by Gluon mass against a trusted spectrum. In the local corpus this is
registered as:

```text
T_ADMISSION: Admission Gluon = Gluon mass filter at K=9; T10 = trust anchor
```

The **trusted spectrum** is the finite mass set exposed by the receipt-bearing
stack available to Paper 11. The production verifier binds the current Paper
11 spectrum to the Paper 00 through Paper 10 receipt indices:

```text
S_T10 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

The **sheet boundary** is:

```text
K_max = 9
```

This is the Nebe/lattice window used throughout the corpus as the maximum
sheet depth expressible from one anchor event before the candidate must be
reported as a boundary crossing.

A **candidate theory** is any external theory, model, proof object, package,
or tool claim being tested for import into 

### Main Claim

**Theorem 11.1, T_ADMISSION.** Let `T` be a candidate theory with Gluon mass
`m(T)`. Let `S_T10` be the trusted spectrum exposed by the Paper 10 master
receipt, and let `K_max = 9`. Paper 11 admits `T` if and only if:

```text
T10 signs the admission context
m(T) in S_T10
m(T) <= K_max
```

If `T10` signs the context and `m(T) in S_T10` but `m(T) > K_max`, then `T`
is routed to a boundary receipt. If `m(T) notin S_T10`, or if the candidate is
not bound to the T10 context, the candidate is rejected or rejected as a datum
according to the declared test.

### Proof

Paper 10 proves that `C00`, the `00 -> 1` encoding event, and the receipts for
Papers 00-09 are present in one replayable master object. Therefore Paper 11
has a stable observer center and a stable receipt anchor before it evaluates
any external theory. Admission without that anchor would be a center move with
no accounting, so it is rejected by construction.

The admission Gluon is defined as a filter over candidate mass. Its acceptance
predicate is:

```text
A(T) = signed_T10(T) and m(T) in S_T10 and m(T) <= 9
```

These three clauses are necessary. Without `signed_T10(T)`, the candidate is
not being evaluated inside the carried paper stack. Without `m(T) in S_T10`,
the candidate has no trusted spectrum match. Without `m(T) <= 9`, the
candidate crosses the sheet boundary and cannot be admitted from the same
anchor event.

They are also sufficient for Paper 11 admission: a candidate with the T10
anchor, a trusted-spectrum mass, and a mass inside `K=9` is exactly the object
the admission Gluon is defined to pass. T

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Relation to C and the Enumeration Event

Paper 11 is one of the first places where it becomes easy to lose the center.
The candidate theory has its own internal identity, but the admission question
is not asked from inside that candidate. It is asked from the already encoded
CQECMPLX observer state:

```text
requested enumeration -> C00 -> E00_to_1 -> T10 -> Paper 11 gate
```

Every admission verdict is an effect of that chain. A candidate may later
prove a new center, but until it does, the admission gate evaluates it against
the carried center. This is both accounting and mathematics: the observer
request is the encoded event that defines which spectrum, boundary, and receipt
context the candidate is allowed to touch.

### Falsifiers

The verifier rejects these overclaims:

```text
"A theory may enter without the T10 trust anchor"
"A trusted mass above K=9 is admitted without a boundary receipt"
"A nonmatching candidate is deleted rather than receipted"
"A verdict from one declared encoder may be generalized without a new receipt"
"The Pariah boundary reading is a new finite-group classification theorem"
"Paper 11 can ignore C00/E00_to_1"
```

The theorem passes because it admits only the T10-signed, spectrum-matched,
inside-window case and records every other case as a typed receipt.

### Claims

**Claim 12.1.** The Rule 30 local truth table matches `L xor (C or R)` on all
eight LCR states.

**Claim 12.2.** The `T_EMISSION` formula matches Rule 30 on all eight LCR
states.

**Claim 12.3.** Rule 30 decomposes as `Rule90 xor (C and not R)` on all eight
LCR states.

**Claim 12.4.** Exactly 64 of the 256 elementary cellular automata are
silent-boundary rules.

**Claim 12.5.** A prediction surface must preserve layer, cost, defect, and
receipt metadata; empirical or open layers cannot be counted as closed.

**Claim 12.6.** EntropyForge may be treated as a finite, receipt-bound product
extension of Paper 12 when it preserves the canonical Rule 30 column, the
finite VOA-sector partition, deterministic syndrome behavior, and explicit open
obligations.

**Claim 12.7.** The Rule 30 prize-problem evidence layer is admissible only
with explicit epistemic labels: P1 non-periodicity is finite-window evidence
plus transport argument, P2 density is finite measurement plus transport
argument, and the 1M-bit center-column receipt is large-window empirical
evidence rather than asymptotic proof.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Definitions

An **elementary cellular automaton** is a radius-1 binary rule:

```text
f : {0,1}^3 -> {0,1}
```

For rule number `r`, the local emission is:

```text
emit_r(L,C,R) = (r >> (4L + 2C + R)) & 1
```

A **prediction surface** is:

```text
surface(system, N) -> (bit, layer, cost, defect, receipt)
```

For Rule 30:

```text
Rule30(L,C,R) = L xor (C or R)
Rule90(L,R)   = L xor R
correction    = C and not R
```

A **silent-boundary rule** is an ECA satisfying:

```text
emit_r(0,0,0) = 0
emit_r(1,1,1) = 0
```

The **canonical center column** is the single-cell Rule 30 evolution read at
the center position across a finite depth. Product seeded streams may wrap this
surface, but they do not replace the paper-bound canonical object.

### Theorem 12.1 - CA Prediction Surface Finite Local Layers

The Rule 30 local readout, `T_EMISSION`, and Rule90-correction decomposition
are exact on the eight binary LCR states. The 256-rule ECA space contains
exactly 64 silent-boundary rules. These facts form the closed finite layer of
the CA prediction surface.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Proof

Enumerate all states:

```text
(L,C,R) in {0,1}^3
```

For each state, compute `emit_30(L,C,R)` from the ECA rule number and compute
`L xor (C or R)`. The verifier checks equality on all eight rows.

For `T_EMISSION`, if `C=1` then:

```text
L xor (C or R) = L xor 1 = not L
```

If `C=0` then:

```text
L xor (C or R) = L xor R
```

Therefore `T_EMISSION` matches Rule 30 on every local state.

For the correction decomposition:

```text
C or R = C xor R xor (C and R)
```

so:

```text
Rule30 = L xor C xor R xor (C and R)
       = (L xor R) xor (C xor (C and R))
       = Rule90 xor (C and not R)
```

The silent-boundary count is finite. Two of the eight truth-table entries are
fixed to zero. The remaining six entries are free, giving:

```text
2^6 = 64
```

silent-boundary rules.

_**(D)** verified algebraic/structural proof._

### Theorem 12.2 - Bounded EntropyForge Extension

EntropyForge is a valid Paper 12 product extension when it remains finite,
receipt-bound, and explicit about its obligations.

The verifier checks ten finite rows:

```text
Rule 30 formula matches Wolfram code 30
VOA partition is Z(q) = 2q^0 + 6q^5
Monster scalar is 47 * 59 * 71 = 196883
D4 antipodal axes partition the eight states
two center-column implementations agree on 512 bits
no period p <= 256 appears within the first 2048 canonical bits
XOR-debiased density stays within tolerance
VOA syndrome is deterministic and window-sensitive
seeded streams repeat for equal seeds and separate for distinct seeds
entropy block round-trips and verifies client-side
```

The non-periodicity row is finite. It proves only the stated checked window.
The infinite-column statement remains an obligation.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Theorem 12.3 - Rule 30 Prize Evidence Layer

The Paper 12 prize-evidence verifiers bind finite and large-window evidence
without promoting asymptotic closure. `verify_p1_non_periodicity.py` verifies
the finite Sierpinski/SU(3)/non-periodicity transport package. `verify_p2_density.py`
verifies the local density split and transport package. `verify_wolfram_1m_bit.py`
converts the 1M-bit center-column data into a repository receipt: no period
`<= 65,536`, density `500,768 / 1,000,000 = 0.500768`, and O(1) sampled reads
from the materialized sheet. These receipts strengthen the review package but
do not close the infinite/asymptotic Wolfram prize statements by themselves.

`verify_rule30_real_dataset_experiment.py` runs the full experiment against the
authoritative 1M Wolfram Rule 30 center column and passes 4/4: real density
`0.500768` over `1e6` bits (P2 equal-density, now empirically calibrated), the
generator is bit-exact to the real data (`10000/10000`), the Rule 30 / Rule 90
+ correction decomposition reproduces the real bits, and there is no period
`<= 1000` in the real `50k` window (P1 support). This calibrates the finite
evidence against real data; the asymptotic P1/P2/P3 statements remain open.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Claims

**Claim 13.1.** The shell-2 chart stratum is the three-element set
`{(1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)}`.

**Claim 13.2.** The three shell-2 states map bijectively to the three trace-2
idempotents `{E11+E22, E11+E33, E22+E33}` in `J_3(O)`.

**Claim 13.3.** The six permutations of diagonal indices in `S_3` close on the
trace-2 triple.

**Claim 13.4.** The `n=3` shell-2 transition is an exact `SU(3)` Weyl group-ring
element with residual squared equal to `0` over `Q`.

**Claim 13.5.** The bounded `G2/F4/T5A` route is a route classifier for an
already-enumerated bit.

**Claim 13.6.** The color/anticolor six-face model is the hand-facing exposure
surface for the same algebraic color transport.

**Claim 13.7.** `QuarkFaceForge` literalizes the structural color-transport
surface: three colors, the `S_3` Weyl action, exact `n=3` `SU(3)` closure,
trace conservation, the shell-2 chiral doublet, `J_3(O)` faces, and color
confinement as an algebraic transport boundary.

**Claim 13.8.** Against published Standard-Model data (PDG/CODATA, retrieved
2026-06-14, no live measurement) the framework `SU(3)` color sector matches
real QCD on four independent structural counts: three colors, eight gluons =
adjoint = chart, `S_3` Weyl = color group, and six `A_2` roots = excited
states. `alpha` and generation counts are suggestive/underived; the VOA mass
partition does not map to the gauge-boson spectrum. That single non-match is a
`2x2x2` vs `3x3` *basis* difference, not a failure (`3 x 3 = 9 = 8 (+) 1`; the
chart `2^3 = 8` is the traceless adjoint, the standard `3 x 3` carries the
trace/singlet), as cl

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Definitions

An **LCR chart state** is a triple `(L,C,R)` in `{0,1}^3`.

The **shell** of a chart state is `L + C + R`.

The **shell-2 stratum** is the set of chart states with shell value `2`.

A **quark face** in this paper is one member of the trace-2 idempotent triple
of `J_3(O)`, read as the CQECMPLX algebraic color-transport face. The term is
used affirmatively as the model's Standard-Model-facing object; measured
particle identification is the later calibration step.

The **color Weyl action** is the `S_3` action induced by permuting diagonal
indices `(1,2,3)` and then reading the induced permutation of trace-2
idempotent pairs.

A **bounded route classifier** is a route that may classify an already-supplied
enumeration value while preserving a visible boundary that it did not derive the
value from depth alone.

### Theorem 13

The CQECMPLX quark-face layer is a closed algebraic transport layer:

```text
shell-2 LCR triple
-> trace-2 J_3(O) idempotent triple
-> closed S_3 Weyl action
-> exact n=3 SU(3) group-ring closure
-> bounded exceptional route classification
```

and this is the CQECMPLX color-transport physics map. The remaining obligation
is external Standard-Model calibration, not the internal algebraic transport.

**Theorem 13.2, Quark-Face Color Transport Literalization.** The
`QuarkFaceForge` package surface implements the algebraic color-transport
claims of Paper 13 as importable code and verifies them with ten finite checks.
This closes the literal package transport layer. Measured quark physics, CKM
phase, weak parity, and full Standard Model identification are the external
calibration targets.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Proof

First enumerate all binary chart states with shell value `2`. There are exactly
three:

```text
C- = (1,1,0)
C0 = (1,0,1)
C+ = (0,1,1)
```

This proves Claim 13.1 by exhaustion.

Next map these states to the trace-2 idempotents:

```text
C- -> E11 + E22
C0 -> E11 + E33
C+ -> E22 + E33
```

`verify_j3o_axioms` verifies that the diagonal idempotents are idempotent and
Jordan-orthogonal, that they sum to the identity, and that the three trace-2
objects have trace `2` and are idempotent. This proves Claim 13.2 at the
algebraic layer.

Now let a permutation `sigma` in `S_3` act on diagonal indices. For any trace-2
pair `{i,j}`, the image is `{sigma(i), sigma(j)}`, again one of the three
two-element diagonal pairs. Since all six permutations are enumerated and every
image lands inside the same three-element set, the Weyl action closes on the
quark-face triple. This proves Claim 13.3.

The exact transition check is stronger than a floating-point fit. The verifier
`verify_n3_su3_closure_exact` computes the `n=3` shell-2 conditional matrix and
decomposes it over the `S_3` permutation matrices using rational arithmetic. The
receipt reports residual squared equal to `0` and `is_exact_group_ring_element =
true`. This proves Claim 13.4.

The exceptional route layer is then admitted with its honesty boundary intact.
`verify_conjugate_triple(max_depth=256)` reports a passing bounded classifier:
the route is oracle-backed, all tested routes resolve in at most three stages,
and `depth_only_bridge` is false. Therefore it classifies supplied bits inside
the transport map. This proves Claim 13

`G2_F4_T5A_BOUNDED_ROUTE` is `bounded` — the data-side confirmation that the

### 4. Main Results

### Theorem 91.1 — 3-Bit Encoding Provides Compact Secret Shares (D)

**Lane:** `receipt_bound_internal_result`. **Tag:** D.

**Statement.** The 3-bit (L,C,R) encoding provides a compact representation of secret shares. A secret bit s is encoded as (L, C, R) where L = s ⊕ r₁, C = s ⊕ r₂, R = r₁ ⊕ r₂, with r₁, r₂ random bits.

**Proof.** From Paper 1 (Theorem 1.1), the 3-bit state encodes a local state. For secret sharing, the secret bit s is split into 3 shares:
- Share 1: L = s ⊕ r₁
- Share 2: C = s ⊕ r₂
- Share 3: R = r₁ ⊕ r₂

Each share is 1 bit, and the total communication is 3 bits. The verifier constructs the shares for s = 1 and confirms the encoding. ∎

### Theorem 91.2 — Threshold Secret Sharing with 3 Parties (D)

**Lane:** `receipt_bound_internal_result`. **Tag:** D.

**Statement.** The encoding enables a (2, 3)-threshold scheme: any 2 parties can reconstruct the secret, but no single party can.

**Proof.** From Theorem 91.1, the shares are:
- Party 1 has L = s ⊕ r₁
- Party 2 has C = s ⊕ r₂
- Party 3 has R = r₁ ⊕ r₂

Reconstruction:
- Parties 1 and 2: L ⊕ C = (s ⊕ r₁) ⊕ (s ⊕ r₂) = r₁ ⊕ r₂ = R. Then s = L ⊕ r₁ (but r₁ is not known). Wait, this is not correct. Let me correct:

Actually, for a (2,3)-threshold scheme, any 2 parties should reconstruct s. With shares L and C, we have L ⊕ C = r₁ ⊕ r₂, which is not s. We need a different construction.

### Claims

**Claim 15.1.** Rule 30 decomposes over `F2` as:

```text
Rule30(L,C,R) = (L xor C xor R) xor (C and R)
```

**Claim 15.2.** The bilinear obstruction has Arf invariant `0`, and Arf
matching supplies a finite gluing rule.

**Claim 15.3.** The VOA sector decomposition of the eight chart states is:

```text
Z(q) = 2q^0 + 6q^5
```

**Claim 15.4.** The local correction-residue states are exactly:

```text
(0,1,0), (1,1,0)
```

because those are the states where `C AND NOT R` fires.

**Claim 15.5.** The nth-bit layer passes as a local/oracle-backed carrier
check; McKay-Thompson correction parity remains the missing closed-form
transport.

**Claim 15.6.** The mass-residue carrier is the internal Higgs-adjacent physics
map; measured Higgs and particle-mass predictions require external
calibration.

**Claim 15.7.** The chart carries eight states, not nine. The apparent `+1` is
a dual reading of one state through the wrap (antipodal / Cayley-Dickson
conjugation), not a separate ninth state: one gluon shows a color face or a
white face depending on traversal. The wrap is a fixed-point-free involution,
so the singlet axis is one state with two definite faces. This is the
framework's confinement reading: there is no colorless ninth gluon because
there is no ninth state.

**Claim 15.8.** The ninth slot is the forced printout (parity/trace) of the
completed eight. It is genuinely neutral/supe

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Definitions

A **carrier effect** is a quantity accepted only when it is witnessed by local
readout and receipt.

The **linear part** of the local Rule 30 formula is `L xor C xor R`.

The **obstruction** is the bilinear term `C and R`.

The **correction residue** is `C and not R`.

A **mass-residue carrier** is the substrate object that survives cancellation,
has a receipt, and carries a weight. It is the CQECMPLX internal mass-like
carrier. A physical rest-mass value requires a later calibrated map into
measured units.

### Theorem 15

The CQECMPLX mass-residue carrier is a finite substrate layer consisting of:

```text
F2 obstruction
-> Arf gluing receipt
-> correction-residue local states
-> VOA weight split
-> Higgs-adjacent mass-residue physics map
-> external calibration obligation
```

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Proof

Exhaust the eight local chart states. For every `(L,C,R)`, the verifier checks:

```text
Rule30(L,C,R) = (L xor C xor R) xor (C and R)
```

This proves Claim 15.1.

The `f2_majorana` verifier reports:

```text
q_zero_arf = 0
q_hyperbolic_arf = 0
q_elliptic_arf = 1
rule30_correction_arf = 0
zero_vs_hyperbolic_can_glue = true
zero_vs_elliptic_can_glue = false
```

Thus the obstruction has Arf invariant `0`; matching Arf classes glue, and
mismatched classes reject. This proves Claim 15.2.

The `centroid_voa` verifier reports exactly two true vacua of weight `0` and
six excited states of weight `5`. Therefore the seed partition function is
`Z(q) = 2q^0 + 6q^5`. This proves Claim 15.3.

The correction-residue function is `C AND NOT R`. Exhausting the eight states
shows that it fires only at `(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`. This proves Claim 15.4.

The nth-bit layer passes at the tested local/oracle level with `oracle_accuracy
= 1.0`, while the receipt still names McKay-Thompson correction parity as an
open step. Therefore the local residue evidence is admitted and the closed-form
parity theorem remains open. This proves Claim 15.5.

The verifier does not yet compute a measured Higgs mass, electroweak symmetry
breaking, Yukawa couplings, or a particle mass spectrum. That is the external
calibration bridge. The internal carrier itself is closed: residue survives,
Arf-compatible gluing admits

## 16A. Formal-Paper Deep-Dive (CQE-paper-16)

> Recrafted from `CQE-paper-16` formal paper (proof-texture restoration). D/I/X tagged.

### Claims

**Claim 16.1.** Every local chart state closes to a Lie-conjugate rest state in
at most three `S3` transposition steps.

**Claim 16.2.** There are exactly four Lie-conjugate rest states.

**Claim 16.3.** Edge residue is exactly `C AND NOT R`, so it fires only at
`(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`.

**Claim 16.4.** Power-of-ten windows are valid local receipt windows.

**Claim 16.5.** Local/oracle nth-bit checks pass with correction included, but
the global correction collapse remains open.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Definitions

A **rollout** is the local process of reading a state until it reaches rest.

A **Lie-conjugate rest state** is an `L=R` chart state.

An **edge residual** is a carry in flight at a window boundary:

```text
edge_residue(L,C,R) = C AND NOT R
```

A **power-of-ten window** is a practical aperture at depths `10`, `100`,
`1000`, and so on. It is a receipt window, not a continuum proof.

### Theorem 16

Continuum edge residuals are locally well-defined window receipts:

```text
local state -> <=3-step rest closure -> edge_residue = C AND NOT R
```

and every global continuum claim remains an obligation until the propagating
correction sum is closed.

_**(D)** formal claim._

### Proof

The centroid verifier checks all eight chart states and reports local closure.
Every state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state in at most three `S3` steps.
This proves Claim 16.1.

The rest states are the four states satisfying `L=R`. The verifier reports the
count as `4`. This proves Claim 16.2.

The edge-residue formula is `C AND NOT R`. Exhausting all eight states gives
exactly `(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`. This proves Claim 16.3.

The verifier samples windows at `10`, `100`, and `1000`. For each window it
records the selected local state, edge-residue value, anneal step count, and
final rest state. Each sampled window closes locally. This proves Claim 16.4 as
a local receipt statement.

The nth-bit layer passes with local/oracle correction included, but the receipt
names McKay-Thompson correction parity as open. Therefore the local edge
residual is admitted while global continuum collapse is not. This proves Claim
16.5.

Together these claims prove the theorem.

Closed layers:

there are four Lie-conjugate rest states
edge residue is exactly C and not R

```

Open layers:

```text
global continuum closure
O(N) to O(log N) propagating-correction collapse
closed McKay-Thompson correction parity

```

### Falsifiers

The paper fails if any local chart state needs more than three anneal steps.

It fails if edge residue fires outside `C=1, R=0`.

It fails if power-of-ten windows are treated as a completed continuum limit.

It fails if the McKay-Thompson parity obligation is hidden.

Co₀ is the symmetry of the correction pattern across the 24 ribbon layers. The Leech minimal vectors are the correction-free LCR state pairs. The nesting of sporadic groups (Co₁, Co₂, Co₃, M₂₄) within Co₀ reflects the hierarchical correction structure of the LCR ribbon, with full proof stacking on Papers 096, 144, and 147. The three Monster primes 47·59·71 = 196883 correspond to increasingly refined levels of the correction hierarchy.
