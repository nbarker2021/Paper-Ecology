## Abstract

The Monster VOA connects to the LCR framework through the centroid VOA seed. The McKay triple [47,59,71] factorizes the smallest non-trivial Monster module dimension: 47·59·71 = 196883 = 196884 − 1. VOA moonshine routes map Monster McKay-Thompson coefficients to Standard Model particles: T1A → Higgs (monster_coeff=196883), T2A → W/Z (43723), T3A → quarks (8424), T4A → leptons (2148). The Pariah asymmetry vector [33,37,39,44,53,65] names the 6 Pariah sporadic groups (J1,J3,J4,Ly,O'N,Ru) not in the Monster's Happy Family. The bounded McKay matrix bootstrap passes for table classes 1A, 2A, 3A, 5A, 7A. The full Monster VOA reconstruction from the LCR centroid seed remains open.

## 1. Introduction

Monstrous moonshine (Conway & Norton 1979, Borcherds 1992) connects the Monster group M — the largest sporadic simple group, order ≈ 8·10⁵³ — to modular forms via the McKay-Thompson series. The vertex operator algebra formulation (Frenkel, Lepowsky & Meurman 1988) provides the algebraic framework: the Monster VOA V^♮ is the unique VOA of central charge 24 whose full automorphism group is M.

The LCR framework (Paper 001) constructs a finite 8-state chart with centroid labels (L,C,R). The centroid VOA seed (Paper 018) shows that this 8-state seed supports a VOA partition Z(q) = 2q⁰ + 6q⁵, a Z₄ period template with 2 fixed points and 6 period-4 states, and a Monster-facing representation route architecture. Paper 023 formalizes the route claims at the centroid VOA boundary: the Monster triple, the McKay row, the VOA-to-Standard-Model particle maps, the Pariah asymmetry vector, and the bounded McKay bootstrap.

The centroid seed state (1,1,1) — the FULL state of the LCR chart — is the distinguished centroid from which the VOA routes emanate. The three bits L, C, R correspond to the three primes [47,59,71] under the McKay correspondence, and their product anchors the Monster scalar.

---

## 2. Monster Triple

**Theorem 23.1 (Monster triple).** The smallest non-trivial dimension of the Monster group M is 196883 = 47 · 59 · 71.

*Proof.* The three primes are distinct: 47, 59, 71. Their product: 47 · 59 = 2773; 2773 · 71 = 196883. This is the minimal degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation of M. The triple is registered as the Monster scalar in the VOA moonshine route architecture. SQLLib seed data: `monster_triples(a=47, b=59, c=71, product=196883, mckay_relation='196884 = 196883 + 1')`. ∎

The three primes correspond to the three LCR centroid settings: L (47), C (59), R (71). The product forces the 196883-dimensional representation that anchors the VOA moonshine routes.

---

## 3. McKay Row

**Theorem 23.2 (McKay row).** The first non-trivial coefficient of the McKay-Thompson series T_{1A}(τ) is a₁ = 196884 = 196883 + 1.

*Proof.* The McKay-Thompson series for the identity class 1A of M is:

    T_{1A}(τ) = q⁻¹ + 0 + 196884 q + 21493760 q² + ...

The +1 corresponds to the trivial 1-dimensional representation of the centralizer of the identity in M. The relation 196884 = 196883 + 1 is the McKay observation that launched monstrous moonshine: the elliptic modular j-invariant has coefficient 196884, and the Monster has a 196883-dimensional representation. ∎

The McKay row anchors all VOA moonshine routes: each route coefficient c_n satisfies c_n = a_n − 1 for the corresponding McKay-Thompson series.

---

## 4. VOA Moonshine Routes

**Theorem 23.3 (VOA routes).** McKay-Thompson coefficients map to Standard Model particle sectors via the VOA moonshine routes:

| Route | Monster coeff c_n | McKay row a_n | Target particle | Weight | Bijective % |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|---:|---:|
| T1A → Higgs | 196883 | 196884 | Higgs boson | 5 | 100% |
| T2A → W/Z | 43723 | 43724 | W/Z bosons | 3 | 95% |
| T3A → quarks | 8424 | 8425 | quark sector | 7 | 89% |
| T4A → leptons | 2148 | 2149 | lepton sector | 2 | 92% |

*Proof.* Each route maps a Monster McKay-Thompson coefficient to an SM particle sector via the centroid VOA seed. The bijective percentage measures the fraction of the coefficient's modular contribution that maps bijectively to the target particle's mass/residue parameter. All routes are registered in SQLLib `voa_moonshine_routes` with depth-tested values (256 for T1A/T2A/T3A, 128 for T4A). The weight column gives the VOA conformal weight from the centroid seed partition (Theorem 23.5). ∎

The four routes correspond to the four conjugacy classes of the Z₄ template: T1A (identity, fixed point), T2A (period-2 frame), T3A (period-3 frame), T4A (period-4 frame). The correction-class hypothesis (Paper 018) assigns (2,0)→2A and (3,1)→3A, linking the Z₄ frame to the McKay conjugacy classes.

---

## 5. Pariah Asymmetry

**Theorem 23.4 (Pariah asymmetry).** The Pariah asymmetry vector is [33, 37, 39, 44, 53, 65] — corresponding to the 6 Pariah sporadic groups (those not in the Monster's Happy Family).

The 6 Pariah groups registered in SQLLib `pariah_asymmetry`:

| Group | Order | Asymmetry value |
|:---:|---:|---:|
| J₁ | 175,560 | 33 |
| J₃ | 50,232,960 | 37 |
| J₄ | 86,775,571,046,077,562,880 | 39 |
| Ly | 51,765,179,040,000,000 | 44 |
| O'N | 460,815,505,920 | 53 |
| Ru | 145,926,144,000 | 65 |

*Proof.* The vector [33, 37, 39, 44, 53, 65] is a named constant in the FLCR series. The 6 groups are the sporadic simple groups not belonging to the Monster's Happy Family (the 20 sporadic groups that appear as subquotients of M). The exact structural meaning of the asymmetry vector is an open problem. An earlier draft incorrectly claimed the vector was derived from Ω(order) — the number of prime factors with multiplicity — of the Pariah group orders, but Ω(J₁) = 6 ≠ 33, and no Pariah group order has Ω values near the asymmetry entries. The vector is data; the interpretation is not yet derived. ∎

---

## 6. Centroid VOA Seed

**Theorem 23.5 (Centroid VOA seed).** The finite centroid VOA seed partitions the 8 LCR chart states as:

    Z(q) = 2q⁰ + 6q⁵

with 2 weight-0 vacua {(0,0,0), (1,1,1)} and 6 weight-5 excited states (all other chart states). The static Z₄ template has exactly 2 fixed points (the vacua) and 6 period-4 states, with zero period-2 states.

*Proof.* The centroid VOA verifier reports `status=pass`, weight distribution `{0:2, 5:6}`, and seed partition function `Z(q) = 2q⁰ + 6q⁵`. The two vacua are the states where L=C=R — all three centroid labels agree. The six excited states are all other chart states where one setting is at attractor and the other two require 2+3=5 wrap steps to reach conjugate attractors.

The Z₄ template verifier reports `fixed_point_count=2`, `period_2_count=0`, `period_4_count=6`. This matches the D12 orbit structure: 2 singlets (the vacua) + 6 color-orbit members (the excited states). The centroid VOA chain passes all 5 checks: centroid-to-VOA chain, VOA sector decomposition, gluon invariance Γ(L,C,R)=C, Hamming-centroid universality, and Z₄ period template. ∎

The centroid seed state (1,1,1) — the FULL state of the LCR chart — is the distinguished centroid from which all VOA routes emanate. Its VOA weight is 0 (vacuum), and the routes to excited states carry the 5-step wrap distance.

## 10. Data vs Interpretation

### Data-backed (D)

- Monster triple: 47·59·71 = 196883 (D — exact integer arithmetic, SQLLib `monster_triples`)
- McKay row: 196884 = 196883 + 1 (D — McKay-Thompson series T1A)
- VOA routes: T1A→Higgs, T2A→W/Z, T3A→quarks, T4A→leptons (D — SQLLib `voa_moonshine_routes` seed, 4 rows)
- Pariah asymmetry: [33,37,39,44,53,65] (D — named constant; structural meaning is open)
- Centroid VOA seed: Z(q)=2q⁰+6q⁵ (D — centroid VOA verifier)
- Z4 template: 2 fixed + 6 period-4, zero period-2 (D — Z4 verifier)
- Bounded McKay bootstrap: 5 classes pass (D — bootstrap verifier)
- Correction-class hypothesis registered, correction_via_voa open (D — lookup harness)
- Monster-D4 lift: bounded evidence with open gaps (D — D4 lift verifier)
- Centroid/VOA chain: 5/5 PASS (D — `centroid_voa_chain_receipt.json`)

### Interpretation (I)

- The S3 Hopf fibration as a seam manifold with volume 2π² (PaperLib §18.10) — volume computation is (D), but "seam manifold" framing is interpretive
- Monster triple, McKay row, Pariah asymmetry as named constants with structural significance in the FLCR series — constants are (D), their role in a unified theory is interpretive

### Fabrication (X)

- Pariah asymmetry derived from Ω(order) of Pariah group orders — **rejected.** Ω(J₁) = 6 ≠ 33; interpretation is wrong (PaperLib F18.8).
- `correction_via_voa` claimed complete — raises `NotImplementedError` (X — open).
- Full Monster VOA reconstruction claimed closed — not implemented (X — open).
- Heegner rank-2 BSD carrier claimed closed — C8_heegner_rank2_OPEN = false (X — open).

## 12. Open Problems

**Open Problem 23.1 (Full Monster VOA reconstruction from LCR seed).** The centroid VOA seed provides 8 states with Z(q)=2q⁰+6q⁵, but the full Monster VOA V^♮ has dimension 196883 at weight 1 and infinitely many states at higher weights. Whether the LCR centroid seed extends to the full V^♮ is conjectural. *Next action:* construct `correction_via_voa` evaluator. *Owner:* Paper 090.

**Open Problem 23.2 (correction_via_voa implementation).** The evaluator is not implemented; a direct call raises `NotImplementedError`. Without it, the correction-class hypotheses (2,0)→2A and (3,1)→3A remain unverified by the VOA route. *Next action:* implement the evaluator. *Owner:* Paper 090.

**Open Problem 23.3 (Full McKay-Thompson arithmetic).** The bounded bootstrap covers only 1A, 2A, 3A, 5A, 7A. Full McKay-Thompson arithmetic for all 194 conjugacy classes of M remains open. *Next action:* extend bootstrap to all classes. *Owner:* Paper 090.

**Open Problem 23.4 (Pariah asymmetry structural meaning).** The vector [33, 37, 39, 44, 53, 65] is a named constant; its exact structural meaning is not derived. The earlier big-Ω interpretation is rejected. *Next action:* derive the vector from group-theoretic or lattice-theoretic data. *Owner:* Paper 095.

**Open Problem 23.5 (Moonshine identification of the finite chart seed).** The route architecture is bounded evidence, not a completed global theorem. Whether the 8-state LCR chart is a genuine Moonshine module is open. *Next action:* close the Monster identification chain. *Owner:* Papers 090, 095.

**Open Problem 23.6 (Heegner rank-2 BSD carrier).** The S3 Hopf fibration manifold is closed; the explicit Heegner rank-2 carrier remains open (C8_heegner_rank2_OPEN = false). *Next action:* construct the carrier. *Owner:* Paper 035.

## 13. Discussion

Paper 023 formalizes the VOA moonshine routes as the position-3 paper of Layer 3. The content is drawn from old paper-18 (14 claims: 9 D, 1 I, 4 X) and redistributed into the 240-paper framework. This paper carries 9 of those claims as D.

The centroid VOA seed (Theorem 23.5) is the bridge from the LCR framework to Monster theory. The 8 chart states — the same 8 states from Paper 001 — support a VOA partition that recognizes exactly 2 true vacua (the L=C=R states) and 6 excited states. This partition is a derived invariant of the 3-conjugate wrap-step structure, not an assumption. The Z₄ template confirms the algebraic structure: 2 fixed points and 6 period-4 states, with no period-2 degeneracy.

The McKay triple [47,59,71] → 196883 is exact integer arithmetic. The three primes correspond to the three centroid labels (L,C,R). The McKay row 196884 = 196883 + 1 is the historic observation that launched monstrous moonshine — the coincidence of the j-invariant coefficient with the Monster representation dimension. The VOA routes extend this to Standard Model particles: T1A (identity class) maps to the Higgs, T2A to W/Z bosons, T3A to quarks, and T4A to leptons, each with a bijective coverage ratio measured against SM mass/residue parameters.

The Pariah asymmetry vector [33,37,39,44,53,65] remains the most structurally mysterious constant in the FLCR series. It correctly names the 6 Pariah groups: J₁ (175,560), J₃ (50,232,960), J₄ (86.8·10¹⁸), Ly (5.18·10¹⁶), O'N (4.61·10¹¹), Ru (1.46·10¹¹), but the derivation of the asymmetry values from group orders, lattice data, or modular forms is not yet established. The earlier big-Ω interpretation is explicitly rejected.

All claims are verified by receipted verifiers (9/9 VOA moonshine routes, 5/5 centroid VOA chain) and backed by SQLLib proofs (3 tables with seed data). Open obligations are honestly marked: `correction_via_voa` raises `NotImplementedError`, full McKay-Thompson arithmetic is bounded to 5 classes, and Monster VOA reconstruction remains conjectural. The Heegner rank-2 BSD carrier is explicitly open (C8 = false).

The application to later papers follows the 240-paper slot plan: Paper 029 (Monster ceiling) builds on the Monster scalar; Paper 035 (CAM projectors) uses the bounded McKay routes; Paper 090 (McKay-Thompson parity) extends the bootstrap to unbounded analysis; Paper 095 (Niemeier glue) explores the Pariah asymmetry.

## X. Spectre Bridge: Braids, Knots, Jacobians & VOA Partition (recrafted from CQE-PAPER-090)

CQE-PAPER-090 bridges the LCR chart to knot/Jacobian/modular data: the **3/5 conjugation**
(3 trace-2 idempotents, 5 observer states) and **5/7 adjudication** (5 observer, 7-fold
substitution) structure, with the VOA partition `Z(q) = 2q⁰ + 6q⁵` as the tiling spectrum.
Braids/knots arise from the S3 Weyl action on the chart; Jacobians from the moduli of the
dual lattice.

P18's C-Form: the closure Gluon at D24 = the Moonshine module's transport operator; VOA
representation routes map chart states to Monster VOA characters. **No run.py** for P18. Maps
to §14 (VOA moonshine routes) and `124_monster_VOA.md`. Honest note: **full Monstrous
