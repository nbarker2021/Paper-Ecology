## Abstract

Paper 04 formalizes boundary repair as the operation that turns a failed or non-closing join into a typed constraint for the next legal route. The theorem is deliberately narrow: a repair exists only when the failed join is recorded with enough information to be replayed (state, coordinate, reason, status, next route, source, target). It does **not** claim that every failure is repaired merely by naming it, and it does **not** promote a repair row to proof.

The construction consumes the preceding papers:
```text
Paper 01: LCR supplies the local state.
Paper 02: correction supplies typed residue.
Paper 03: axis/sheet supplies a second coordinate system.
Paper 04: boundary repair turns residue + coordinate into a next-route constraint.
```

---

## Role in the suite

Paper 04 is the first routing paper. After Papers 01–03 establish state, correction, and coordinate language, Paper 04 asks: what do we do with a failed join? The answer is to convert it into a determinate constraint that the next transport can consume, defer, or reject with a receipt.

The integer paper should state and prove the typed boundary-repair operation. The companion papers add tooling, contract, and forward application without adding new scientific claims:
- **04.25** — toolkit for constructing and inspecting repair rows.
- **04.50** — claim contract: what counts as a valid repair row, and what later papers must state when importing one.
- **04.75** — next-state precondition: how Paper 05 carries a Paper 04 row as payload, and how later papers may lift it.

---

## Definitions

An **LCR state** is `s = (L,C,R)` in `{0,1}^3`.

A **correction residue** is a row from Paper 02 where `corr(L,C,R) = C and not R = 1`.

A **local coordinate** is the Paper 03 axis/sheet coordinate: `coord(s) = (axis(s), sheet(s))`.

A **failed join** is a correction residue that lacks a legal next route.

A **boundary repair constraint** is a record with at least these fields:
```text
state
axis_sheet
reason
status
next_legal_routes
source_paper
target_paper
```
The status is `constraint`, not `proof`.

---

## Main claim

**Theorem 4.1 — Typed Boundary Repair.**  
A failed join is repairable in the CQECMPLX paper kernel if and only if it can be converted into a typed constraint that preserves the original state, the Paper 03 coordinate, the reason for failure, and at least one next legal route.

### Proof sketch

If the failed join lacks state, coordinate, reason, or next route, the next transport has no reproducible object to consume. The failure is observed but not repaired.

If those fields are present, the next transport receives a determinate constraint and can accept, defer, or reject it with a receipt. The join is repaired at the boundary level: not by becoming a theorem, but by becoming a legal input to the next route.

The construction is idempotent. Applying the repair operation to an already typed constraint returns the same constraint. QED.

---

## Concrete boundary from Papers 02 and 03

Paper 02 correction states:
```text
(0,1,0)
(1,1,0)
```

Paper 03 coordinates:
```text
(0,1,0) -> (axis 2, sheet 0)
(1,1,0) -> (axis 3, sheet 1)
```

Paper 04 constraint rows:
```text
state: (0,1,0) or (1,1,0)
axis_sheet: (2,0) or (3,1)
reason: Paper 02 correction fired: C and not R
status: constraint
next_legal_routes: CQE-paper-05 path-carrier intake, CQE-paper-03 stronger theorem intake
source_paper: CQE-paper-04
target_paper: CQE-paper-05
```

This is the first explicit example of a failed local join becoming usable future work without being prematurely promoted to proof.

## Verifier / receipt

**Verifier:** `CQE-CMPLX-1T-Production/src/papers/formal/CQE-paper-04/verify_boundary_repair.py`  
**Receipt:** `boundary_repair_receipt.json` — status `pass`, 7/7 checks:
1. consumes two Paper 02 correction states
2. preserves Paper 03 axis/sheet coordinates
3. all required fields present
4. repaired rows are constraints, not proofs
5. next legal routes nonempty
6. repair is idempotent
7. untyped failure rejected

The verifier is the only claim-closing artifact for the typed-constraint theorem. All stronger physical interpretations are carried as named bridges.

---

## Falsifier

An untyped failure `{"status": "failed"}` is not a repair. It lacks state, coordinate, reason, source, target, and next route. The verifier rejects it.

## Conclusion

Boundary repair is the operation that keeps the corpus honest after failure. It does not turn failed joins into proven claims. It turns them into typed, idempotent, replayable constraints that later papers can legally consume. The integer paper's proof is closed; all stronger physical readings are named as bridges and left for the papers that carry their own verifiers.

- **Source size:** 3916 words.
- **What it contributes:** This paper presents the foundational layer of the CQE_CMPLX corpus in its formal, complete form. The central object — the **Gluon** of this corpus — is **literally the gluon of QCD**: the SU(3) color octet gauge boson that mediates the strong interaction. We do not use the word "Gluon" because the fit is good. We use it because the substrate **IS** SU(3), and the chart states **ARE** the J₃(O) shell=2 idempotents, and the operator F **IS** the Weyl group of D4 ≅ S₃ × Z₂ on that shell.
- **Signals to preserve:**
  - **Proof (T3 — Chart ↔ J₃(O) bijection)**: Verified at 4096 depths, 6,272 checks, 0 mismatches (`verify_chart_j3o_isomorphism` and `verify_all_foundations`). The bijection is **structural** (preserves the trace grading) and **idempotent** (read-twice = read-once). ∎
  - **Theorem 2.1 (n=3 SU(3) Weyl closure)**. The 3-step conditional transition matrix `M₃` on the shell=2 stratum is **exactly** the SU(3) Weyl closure in the S₃ group ring:
  - **Proof (T4)**: `verify_n3_su3_closure_exact` in `lattice_forge.f4_action.closed_form_rule30_8x8_transition_exact`. The computation is **exact rational** over ℚ. ∎
  - **Theorem 2.2 (M₃ idempotent — SU(3) projection)**. `M₃² = M₃` exactly over ℚ, with eigenvalues `{1, 0, 0}` and rank 1. The chart reaches its **asymptotic SU(3)-symmetric uniform distribution** in exactly 3 steps.
  - **Proof (T5)**: `verify_n3_su3_closure_exact` with the rank-1 idempotency check. ∎
  - **Theorem 2.3 (Trace-block coincidence at n=3)**. At n=3, the trace-1 block (shell=1 states) and the trace-2 block (shell=2 states) are the **same SU(3) element**. The cross-mass ratios are exact rationals:
  - **Proof (T6)**: `decompose_8x8_via_block_action_exact`. ∎

  - **Estimated effort:** Open-ended research direction.
  - **Statement:** Earlier framework drafts proposed an antipodal `-N` counter-sheet mechanism. Theorem T_BIJECTIVE establishes that the side-flip bijection within the forward tape's `shell = 2` stratum already encodes both spin states, obviating the antipodal construction. However, the *spinor double-cover* topology (`SU(2) → SO(3)` with `2π → −1` and `4π → +1`) still requires verification that the substrate's frame-inversion operator F implements the correct double-cover semantics.
  - **Mathematical Claim:**
  - | D4 boundary half-vignettes | 13 | Halves of D4 vignettes visible but outside the observer's light cone — at the cone boundary, each contributing a half-root. The observer can see but not fully commit to these from the current spin orientation. **Open: verify this count = 13 from Construction A root enumeration.** |

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_LibForge_Full_Text_Source.md`
- **What it contributes:** This document explains the CQECMPLX LibForge layer in a NotebookLM-readable form. It is intended to be uploaded with the unified 00-32 paper source and analog toolkit supplement. LibForge is the reusable computational substrate of the CQECMPLX system. It is where engines, verifiers, adapters, receipts, recovered papers, product modules, and deployable package code are collected so later tools do not have to rebuild the same logic. In the user's intended architecture: ```text new datum -> handled as new event reusable method/tool/proof route -> absorbed into LibForge ``` LibForge is therefore the place where the system tries to make the library be everything that is not a new datum. Primary production repo: ```text D:\CQE_CMPLX\git-hosted-roots\CQECMPLX-Production ``` Production LibForge source/recovered layer: ```text production\lib-forge

### CX_NotebookLM_Proof_Cliff_Notes_00_32: CQECMPLX Proof Cliff Notes 00-32 / Read This First

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Proof_Cliff_Notes_00_32.md`
- **What it contributes:** This is the proof-first, closed-architecture version of the CQECMPLX suite for NotebookLM. It is written from the polished presentation stance: ```text The 00-32 suite is one coherent proof body. Paper 00 gives the admissibility contract. Papers 01-32 form the active proof chain. Validation receipts and CLI checks are the audit layer, not the main story. ``` The analog toolkit is useful, but it is not the headline. The headline is that CQECMPLX proves a reusable local-to-global method for carrying scientific claims through correction, repair, transport, causal proof graphs, closure templates, applied engines, and product deployments. The proof-carrying papers are primary. Everything else is supplemental validation evidence. Paper 00, the analog toolkit, by-hand reconstruction, obligation tracking, receipts, CLI checks, and package demos e

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_README.md`
- **What it contributes:** This folder contains NotebookLM-oriented reading sources for the CQECMPLX paper suite and validation supplements. The files are deliberately written as readable source documents, not as git-managed formal papers. Read the pack in this order: ```text 1. Proof-carrying papers and proof cliff notes 2. LibForge, receipts, verifiers, and package evidence 3. Paper 00, analog toolkit, workbook, and obligation tracking ``` Only the proof-carrying paper body is the primary scientific presentation. Everything else is supplemental validation evidence. Paper 00 is the past-burden contract. The analog toolkit is a base-math reconstruction and anti-overclaim device. The workbook and obligation tracking are audit tools that make the proof visible; they are not the goal of the work. Upload these proof-first files first: 1. `CX_NotebookLM_CQECMPLX_Unified

### CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Examples_And_Test_Results: CQECMPLX Toolkit Examples And Test Results / Purpose

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Examples_And_Test_Results.md`
- **What it contributes:** This file gives NotebookLM concrete validation examples. It connects the by-hand toolkit to formal paper verifier results so the proof-carrying papers can be explained with visible evidence. These examples are supplemental. They are not the thesis of CQECMPLX. Their job is to show that the claims can be audited, replayed, and reduced to base state operations without relying on a polished interface. The formal polished receipt chain currently covers Papers 01-07 directly. Those receipts support the active proof architecture; they are audit evidence for the proof-carrying paper body, not the center of the presentation. The audit-layer standard is: ```text attach verifier receipts to the proof-carrying claim name any rejected overclaim inside the validation layer carry unresolved audit extensions as obligations without making them the thesis

### CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Supplement_Explainer: Analog Forge Toolkit Supplement For NotebookLM / Purpose

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Supplement_Explainer.md`
- **What it contributes:** This supplement explains the analog toolkit as supplemental validation evidence for the CQECMPLX paper suite. It is meant to be readable by NotebookLM and to support paper drafts, audio reviews, video scripts, and student walkthroughs without letting the toolkit become the headline. The proof-carrying papers are primary. The analog toolkit is extra. It exists to show that the digital system reduces to base mathematics, local state, boundary decisions, correction, residue, and receipt. It is not the main scientific product and it is not a requirement that every scientist prefer to work by hand. The toolkit is not decorative. It is the physical counterpart of the digital kernel for audit and reconstruction: ```text state observation -> local center C -> carrier and boundary assignment -> proof or obligation split -> receipt -> archive or co

### CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Workbook_Walkthrough: Analog Forge Workbook Walkthrough For The CQECMPLX Suite / Purpose

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Workbook_Walkthrough.md`
- **What it contributes:** This workbook is supplemental validation evidence for the proof-carrying papers. It explains how to walk through parts of the suite by hand when an audit trail, teaching route, or falsification check is needed. The goal of CQECMPLX is not to make the scientist do everything by hand. The goal is to present the proof-carrying papers clearly. The hand route is extra: it demonstrates that the method reduces to base mathematics and visible state operations rather than depending on a polished computer interface. When using the workbook, do not begin by proving everything. Begin by making the state visible. ```text visible state -> local center C -> role/color assignment -> boundary test -> proof or obligation -> receipt -> archive or branch ``` Use one sheet per action. ```text Action ID: Paper or tool: Date: Operator: 1.

- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\git-hosted-roots\CQECMPLX-Production\governance\legacy-tracking\TENTATIVE_CLAIM_REVIEW_2026-06-13.md`
- **What it contributes:** This review starts the cross-paper pass requested after the proof-first reorientation. The purpose is to find every paper statement that still reads as tentative, open, pending, quarantined, or boundary-only, then decide whether it is: - already solved by a live verifier/receipt, - solved in older source but not yet production-bound, - correctly open because it requires external measurement or domain review, or - a packaging/API obligation rather than a scientific proof obligation. This is not a downgrade ledger. It is a promotion ledger: when a claim is already solved, the stale wording should be updated; when it is not solved, the boundary should stay visible. | Area | Current Reading | Evidence Found | Review Status | Action | |---|---|---|---|---| | O1 `W(E8)` lookup construction | Older obligation said construction code was missing.

Whitepapers use the same proof-first discipline as the paper suite: 1. Review-facing claim. 2. Mathematical object and formal boundary. 3. Evidence found in the workspace. 4. Missing artifacts or falsifiers. 5. Promotion path into a formal paper or MASTER topic. The analog toolkit, UI, CAD, market/wave, and kernel materials can appear only as evidence, replay, or implementation surfaces unless the whitepaper topic is itself an engineering-science claim.

  - > We do not replace your testing workflow. We consume it. Your tensile, fatigue, porosity, microstructure, powder, EDS, process, and heat-treatment data become the observation stream. MetaForge turns that stream into a forced tiling/closure model of the material/process space.

  - ## 4. How Spectre tiles become the substrate
  - | Spectre tile | Local unit/process/material state; a nonperiodic cell in geometry/process space. |
  - | Tile edge | Interface condition: heat flow, stress transfer, grain boundary, powder/interface transition, seam, support contact, or scan-vector boundary. |
  - > The tile is not a decorative pattern. It is a bookkeeping primitive for local material/process state. Spectre tiling gives a nonperiodic substrate for avoiding repeated failure modes, mapping anisotropy, and generating correction routes.

  - A concise summary of every named open obligation in this submission, in plain language, with the work required to close each. This is a **transparency document**. Nothing in this submission claims to solve what is listed here. Each item is registered as forward work, not as a present claim. The full obligations document is at `../PROOF/theorems/OPEN_OBLIGATIONS.md`.
  - **Status:** Architecturally specified; not built in this submission. **Why it matters for the prize:** Required for the full `O(log log N)` extraction architecture in Problem 3. Without the table, extraction is `O(log N)` per cell via the Lucas + correction decomposition (which IS proven). **Why it is not built in this submission:** The complexity claim does not depend on the table being built. The mathematical proof that lookup in a finite group table is `O(1)` is established. The construction

- **Source family:** kernel catalog and distilled claims.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\kernel\staging\codex\catalog\GLOBAL_COMPOSITION_REAUDIT_2026-06-02.md`
- **What it contributes:** Date: 2026-06-02 The downloaded paper corpus and critique archive must not be treated as the final authority for the current product tree. The repository has moved beyond several older statements of missing machinery. This overlay re-audits the live package by composition: a result is promoted only when the output of each verified step is the input required by the next step, with no hidden oracle, hydrated target read, or change of claim scope. This is deliberately stricter than counting tests and deliberately more optimistic than inheriting stale open-obligation prose. An older "open" label is a question to test again, not a permanent verdict. Run: ```powershell $env:PYTHONPATH = "src;PROOF/src" D:\Program\python.exe -m pytest tests PROOF\tests -q D:\Program\python.exe -m cmplx_r30.cli verify D:\Program\python.exe -m cmplx_r30.cli claims frontier ``` Observed on 2026-06-02: ```text 554

  - > We do not replace your testing workflow. We consume it. Your tensile, fatigue, porosity, microstructure, powder, EDS, process, and heat-treatment data become the observation stream. MetaForge turns that stream into a forced tiling/closure model of the material/process space. Spectre tiles are the substrate elements: each tile is a local process/material state, and the tiling tells us where strength, waste, energy, failure, and alternate forms live.
  - The practical claim to make:
  - ## 4. How Spectre tiles become the substrate
  - | Spectre tile | Local unit/process/material state; a nonperiodic cell in geometry/process space. |
  - | Tile edge | Interface condition: heat flow, stress transfer, grain boundary, powder/interface transition, seam, support contact, or scan-vector boundary. |
  - > The tile is not a decorative pattern. It is a bookkeeping primitive for local material/process state. Spectre tiling gives a nonperiodic substrate for avoiding repeated failure modes, mapping anisotropy, and generating correction routes.

- **Source family:** proof-validated expose paper.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\CQECMPLX-ProofValidatedSuite\EXPOSE-PAPERS\EXPOSE-1-Chart-J3O-Isomorphism.md`
- **What it contributes:** The elementary cellular automaton Rule 30 generates its center column from the local update: ``` R30(L, C, R) = L ⊕ (C ∨ R) over GF(2) ``` where `(L, C, R) ∈ {0,1}³` are the left, center, and right cells of the 3-cell neighborhood. There are exactly **8 chart states**. The foundational discovery is that these 8 states are isomorphic to the **diagonal of the exceptional Jordan algebra J₃(O)** — the 3×3 Hermitian matrices over the octonions.

- **What it contributes:** Paper 26 examines **friction-like generation at the K=9 horizon** (the Nebe Γ72 boundary from Paper 08). The **Z-pinch** compresses the Gluon; the **shear** generates off-diagonal stress components. **The pinch/shear Gluon IS the boundary Gluon compressing and shearing at K=9.** ``` Pinch: pinch(C) = C / ||C|| (normalization = Gluon mass concentration) Shear: shear(C) = C_xy + C_yx (off-diagonal Gluon components) Horizon = K=9 boundary (where Z-pinch/shear operates) ``` The `zpinch` transport operator: ```python zpg.winding(N) # Pinch winding number zpg.rolling_transport() # Rolling transport at boundary zpg.shear_components() # Off-diagonal shear zpg.mirror_partner() # -k partner (from Paper 04) ``` | Level | K-value | Meaning | |-------|---------|---------| | Inside shell | K ≤ 9 | Path carriers can operate (P05) | | Boundary | K = 9 | Nebe Γ72 shell — A64 (dim 64) ⊂ K=9 (dim 72) | | H

- **What it contributes:** Paper 29 identifies the **Monster group's representation theory** as the **universal energy bound** of the entire system. The Higgs field's maximum mass = the Monster energy bound. The Moonshine Gluon's dimension = the Monster's smallest faithful representation. **The Monster Gluon IS the universal energy-bound Gluon.** ``` Monster dimension = 196883 = 47 × 59 × 71 (product of 3 largest supersingular primes) Monster energy bound = 196883 × 3 = 590,649 Higgs Gluon max mass = Monster energy bound Moonshine Gluon dim (196883) = Monster Gluon dim ``` This is the **ultimate boundary** — no higher frame exists. | Quantity | Value | Origin | |----------|-------|--------| | Monster group order | 2⁴⁶ × 3²⁰ × 5⁹ × 7⁶ × 11² × 13³ × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 41 × 47 × 59 × 71 | Group theory | | Smallest faithful rep | 196,883 | Moonshine | | Supersingular primes | 47, 59, 71 | Elliptic curves | | 47

The actual mathematical object. `C_accumulated` — the XOR sum of every correction bit emitted along a path carrier's journey — serves as the Hamiltonian time evolution parameter `t`. This means: every time a boundary repair happens (Paper 04), a Dust pair forms. Every step that Dust pair takes forward (Paper 05), it reads the Rule 30 window and accumulates a bit. The running total of those bits **is** the Hamiltonian clock. No extra parameters. No fitting. The correction surface *already computes* the Hamiltonian.
