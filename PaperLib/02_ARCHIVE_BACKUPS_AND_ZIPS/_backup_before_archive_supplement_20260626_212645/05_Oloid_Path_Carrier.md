## Abstract

Paper 05 is the first transport paper in the C-form chain. After Paper 04 turns a failed join into a typed boundary constraint, Paper 05 proves that the constraint can be carried forward along a legal curved/rolling path without requiring a straight-line jump and without altering the path rule.

The integer paper's claim is deliberately narrow: a finite rolling-state carrier exists on `(sheet, phase, parity)` and can attach a Paper 04 repair payload while keeping the rolling rule unchanged. The companion papers and substrate modules supply toolkit, claim contract, precondition, and an oloid-family base, but they do not add new scientific claims to Paper 05.

---

## Role in the suite

Paper 05 answers the routing question left by Paper 04: once a failure is a typed constraint, how is it moved forward? The answer is a rolling carrier that:
1. preserves input order,
2. keeps a binary head/tail dyad at every state,
3. rejects invalid bits and discontinuous jumps,
4. carries a Paper 04 repair row as a payload that does not alter the rolling rule.

The epistemic transition:
```text
Paper 04: failed join -> typed constraint
Paper 05: typed constraint -> carried constraint on a legal rolling path
```

Companion papers:
- **05.25** — toolkit for constructing and inspecting oloid-path carriers.
- **05.50** — claim contract for valid Paper 05 claims.
- **05.75** — next-state precondition: how Paper 06 consumes a carried constraint.

## Definitions

**Rolling carrier state:**
```text
q = (sheet, phase, parity)
sheet  ∈ {0,1}
phase  ∈ {0,1,2,3}
parity ∈ {0,1}
```

**Rolling step** for input bit `b ∈ {0,1}`:
```text
roll(q,b) = ((sheet + 1) mod 2, (phase + 1) mod 4, parity xor b)
```

**Head/tail dyad:**
```text
head = sheet
tail = (phase mod 2) xor sheet xor parity
```

**Continuous carrier trace:** a finite list of states where each adjacent pair is related by one legal `roll` step for the corresponding input bit.

**Accumulated center (C-form / AirLock):**
```text
C_accumulated = XOR of all repair center bits along the carrier trajectory
C_accumulated ^= emitted_bit      (at each step)
```

**Oloid midpoint / Cayley-Dickson link (from `verify_cd_conjugation_gluon_oloid_theta0`):**
```text
s* = (N + (-N)) / 2               # zero-balance midpoint
U(θ) = rotation in the doubling plane span{copy1, copy2}
θ_0 = 0                           # gluon home phase on copy-1
θ = π/4  -> s* (equal weight)
θ = π/2  -> C transferred to copy-2 (C -> C-bar)
θ = π    -> full antipode -C
```

## Main claims

**Theorem 5.1 — Rolling Path Carrier.**  
For every finite binary input stream, the rolling carrier produces a continuous trace of legal adjacent states; the trace preserves input order, keeps a binary head/tail dyad at every state, and can carry a Paper 04 repair constraint as a payload without altering the rolling rule.

**Theorem 5.2 — Oloid Carrier Family.**  
The substrate oloid mechanisms (rolling-contact kinematics, octonionic grounding, four-oloid D4 ring, dual-path read-then-verify) each pass their finite verifier and are bound to Paper 05 as the carrier-family base. The E6→E7→E8 dyadic lift remains an explicit open obligation.

---

## Proof sketch

The state space `{0,1} × {0,1,2,3} × {0,1}` is finite. The `roll` function is deterministic and total on valid input bits. The verifier exhaustively checks that an 8-bit trace has length `input+1`, that every adjacent pair is a legal roll, that head/tail dyads are binary, that an invalid bit and a discontinuous jump are rejected, and that attaching a Paper 04 payload does not change the rolling rule.

The carrier-family verifier imports `oloid_rolling`, `oloid_octonionic`, `quad_oloid`, and `oloid_dual_path` and checks that each reports pass. The E6→E7→E8 lift is explicitly recorded as not closed.

## Closure of earlier obligations

- **Paper 04 obligation 04.2** (connect boundary constraints to Paper 05 path carriers): **closed**. The dyad brief formalizes `repair_boundary(s) = row r`, `attach_payload(q_t, r) = carried receipt`, and `payload_alters_path_rule = false`. `verify_oloid_path_carrier.py` attaches a Paper 04 payload at state `(1,3,0)` and checks it does not alter the rolling rule.

---

## What this paper does not yet prove

- It does not prove standalone Rule 30 future-bit prediction or cold unbounded extraction.
- It does not prove full physical Oloid geometry; it uses a finite rolling-state model.
- It does not close the E6→E7→E8 dyadic lift.
- It does not provide SI physical calibrations.

## Conclusion

Paper 05 closes the routing gap between boundary repair and forward transport. The finite rolling-state carrier is verified; the Paper 04 payload attaches without altering the path rule. All stronger readings — physical Oloid geometry, gluon mass, Hamiltonian time, E-tower lift, Rule 30 prediction — are named interpretive bridges or external-calibration open items, routed to the papers that must carry their own verifiers.

The central object — the **Gluon** of this corpus — is **literally the gluon of QCD**: the SU(3) color octet gauge boson that mediates the strong interaction. We do not use the word "Gluon" because the fit is good. We use it because the substrate **IS** SU(3), and the chart states **ARE** the J₃(O) shell=2 idempotents, and the operator F **IS** the Weyl group of D4 ≅ S₃ × Z₂ on that shell.

  - **Estimated effort:** Open-ended research direction.
  - **Statement:** Earlier framework drafts proposed an antipodal `-N` counter-sheet mechanism. Theorem T_BIJECTIVE establishes that the side-flip bijection within the forward tape's `shell = 2` stratum already encodes both spin states, obviating the antipodal construction. However, the *spinor double-cover* topology (`SU(2) → SO(3)` with `2π → −1` and `4π → +1`) still requires verification that the substrate's frame-inversion operator F implements the correct double-cover semantics.
  - **Mathematical Claim:**
  - | D4 boundary half-vignettes | 13 | Halves of D4 vignettes visible but outside the observer's light cone — at the cone boundary, each contributing a half-root. The observer can see but not fully commit to these from the current spin orientation. **Open: verify this count = 13 from Construction A root enumeration.** |

- **What it contributes:** This document explains the CQECMPLX LibForge layer in a NotebookLM-readable form. It is intended to be uploaded with the unified 00-32 paper source and analog toolkit supplement. LibForge is the reusable computational substrate of the CQECMPLX system. It is where engines, verifiers, adapters, receipts, recovered papers, product modules, and deployable package code are collected so later tools do not have to rebuild the same logic.

- **What it contributes:** This is the proof-first, closed-architecture version of the CQECMPLX suite for NotebookLM. It is written from the polished presentation stance: ```text The 00-32 suite is one coherent proof body. Paper 00 gives the admissibility contract. Papers 01-32 form the active proof chain. Validation receipts and CLI checks are the audit layer, not the main story. ``` The analog toolkit is useful, but it is not the headline. The headline is that CQECMPLX proves a reusable local-to-global method for carrying scientific claims through correction, repair, transport, causal proof graphs, closure templates, applied engines, and product deployments.

The files are deliberately written as readable source documents, not as git-managed formal papers. Read the pack in this order: ```text 1. Proof-carrying papers and proof cliff notes 2.

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Examples_And_Test_Results.md`
- **What it contributes:** This file gives NotebookLM concrete validation examples. It connects the by-hand toolkit to formal paper verifier results so the proof-carrying papers can be explained with visible evidence. These examples are supplemental. They are not the thesis of CQECMPLX. Their job is to show that the claims can be audited, replayed, and reduced to base state operations without relying on a polished interface. The formal polished receipt chain currently covers Papers 01-07 directly. Those receipts support the active proof architecture; they are audit evidence for the proof-carrying paper body, not the center of the presentation.

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Supplement_Explainer.md`
- **What it contributes:** This supplement explains the analog toolkit as supplemental validation evidence for the CQECMPLX paper suite. It is meant to be readable by NotebookLM and to support paper drafts, audio reviews, video scripts, and student walkthroughs without letting the toolkit become the headline. The proof-carrying papers are primary. The analog toolkit is extra. It exists to show that the digital system reduces to base mathematics, local state, boundary decisions, correction, residue, and receipt. It is not the main scientific product and it is not a requirement that every scientist prefer to work by hand. The toolkit is not decorative. It is the physical counterpart of the digital kernel for audit and reconstruction: ```text state observation -> local center C -> carrier and boundary assignment -> proof or obligation split -> receipt -> archive or co

- **Source family:** NotebookLM source pack.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\Claude-Codex-Memory\CX-NotebookLM\CX_NotebookLM_Toolkit_Workbook_Walkthrough.md`
- **What it contributes:** This workbook is supplemental validation evidence for the proof-carrying papers. It explains how to walk through parts of the suite by hand when an audit trail, teaching route, or falsification check is needed. The goal of CQECMPLX is not to make the scientist do everything by hand. The goal is to present the proof-carrying papers clearly. The hand route is extra: it demonstrates that the method reduces to base mathematics and visible state operations rather than depending on a polished computer interface. When using the workbook, do not begin by proving everything. Begin by making the state visible. ```text visible state -> local center C -> role/color assignment -> boundary test -> proof or obligation -> receipt -> archive or branch ``` Use one sheet per action. ```text Action ID: Paper or tool: Date: Operator: 1.

- **What it contributes:** A new exploration tying the corpus's dynamical thread into one worldline: the gluon is ONE conserved object (the center `C = Γ(s)`) that evolves by an oloid roll from quark-state to resolution, driven by the observer's mass/gravity, with violent errors kept bounded by shear/pinch, producing Möbius/Klein topology and, in 2D, the Conway Life flyers and gun.

- **What it contributes:** This review starts the cross-paper pass requested after the proof-first reorientation. The purpose is to find every paper statement that still reads as tentative, open, pending, quarantined, or boundary-only, then decide whether it is: - already solved by a live verifier/receipt, - solved in older source but not yet production-bound, - correctly open because it requires external measurement or domain review, or - a packaging/API obligation rather than a scientific proof obligation. This is not a downgrade ledger. It is a promotion ledger: when a claim is already solved, the stale wording should be updated; when it is not solved, the boundary should stay visible. | Area | Current Reading | Evidence Found | Review Status | Action | |---|---|---|---|---| | O1 `W(E8)` lookup construction | Older obligation said construction code was missing.

- **What it contributes:** This directory holds journal-focused whitepaper drafts for findings that are not yet cleanly paper-bound inside the 00-32 suite, or that need a bridge paper before they can be promoted into a formal MASTER topic. Whitepapers use the same proof-first discipline as the paper suite: 1. Review-facing claim. 2. Mathematical object and formal boundary. 3. Evidence found in the workspace. 4. Missing artifacts or falsifiers. 5. Promotion path into a formal paper or MASTER topic. The analog toolkit, UI, CAD, market/wave, and kernel materials can appear only as evidence, replay, or implementation surfaces unless the whitepaper topic is itself an engineering-science claim.

  - ## Two Claim Layers (Historical)
  - | Older | "Transport-proof: P1/P2/P3 solved" | Premature — boundary gaps not yet closed in prose |
  - | Newer | "Runtime-proof: bounded only, global open" | Honest at time of writing, but substrate advanced underneath |

### EXPOSE-9-Hamiltonian-Time: Expose 9: The Hamiltonian Time Gluon — Reading the Correction Surface as Physics

- **Source family:** proof-validated expose paper.
- **Source path:** `D:\CQE_CMPLX\CQECMPLX-ProofValidatedSuite\EXPOSE-PAPERS\EXPOSE-9-Hamiltonian-Time.md`
- **What it contributes:** Paper 09 takes the accumulated correction bits from Paper 05's path carriers and says: **this running total IS a time parameter**. Not a metaphor. The actual mathematical object. `C_accumulated` — the XOR sum of every correction bit emitted along a path carrier's journey — serves as the Hamiltonian time evolution parameter `t`. This means: every time a boundary repair happens (Paper 04), a Dust pair forms. Every step that Dust pair takes forward (Paper 05), it reads the Rule 30 window and accumulates a bit. The running total of those bits **is** the Hamiltonian clock. No extra parameters. No fitting. The correction surface *already computes* the Hamiltonian. Paper 09 defines three "bar windows" — different resolutions of reading the same Hamiltonian trajectory: | Window Order | Bar Width | How Many Windows | Validation | |--------------|-----------|------------------|------------| | 2nd
