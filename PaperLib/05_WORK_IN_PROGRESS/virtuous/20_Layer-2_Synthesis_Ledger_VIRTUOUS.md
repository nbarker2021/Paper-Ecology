## Virtuous Synthesis

This paper defines the Layer-2 synthesis ledger: the suite-level accounting
surface that aggregates solved, open, failed, forbidden, and transported rows
without changing their source-paper status. The closed result is ledger
behavior. The seed ledger verifies, the rank-24 terminal registry contains
twenty-four forms, reachability distinguishes `yes_with_template_glue`, `no`,
and `unknown`, the transport-obligation verifier returns
`pass_with_open_lifts`, and the contributions registry admits rows only through
a named validator.

This version treats the formal paper as the proof spine, the companion variants as interface contracts, and the CAM/GLM rows as status-bearing crystal data. The paper's open obligations are not deleted; they are the next work items required before stronger claims can be promoted.

## Obligation Springboard Lanes

Obligations return to the earliest paper they can affect, then rework upward through each paper in the lane before the local claim is promoted.

### Local Claim Pressure

- Receipt-closed items may strengthen replayability and audit language, but they do not close unrelated transport, physical, or cold-start mathematical obligations.
- Guard obligations must appear next to the claims they constrain, so the reader cannot miss the boundary.

### Local Lane Table

| Obligation | Return start | Upward lane | Rework instruction |
|------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| `20.1` | `09` | `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20` | Rewrite surrounding prose so the guard is visible at the point where a reader might otherwise infer a stronger claim. |
| `20.2` | `09` | `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20` | Rewrite surrounding prose so the guard is visible at the point where a reader might otherwise infer a stronger claim. |
| `20.3` | `09` | `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20` | Strengthen receipt/path language and ensure any downstream theorem depends on replayable receipts rather than assumed file layout. |

## Detailed Expansion Pass

### Paper-Level Thesis

Paper 20 functions as the suite's layer-2 synthesis ledger and reachability status surface. Its virtuous version should therefore make three layers visible at once: the formal claim that is actually proved, the receipt or verifier evidence that lets the claim be replayed, and the explicit boundary that prevents the reader from promoting an open lift into a closed theorem.

The companion variants are used as exposition and interface contracts. They may contribute terminology, examples, and downstream preconditions, but the canonical formal paper remains the proof spine.

### Claim Status Ledger

| Claim/Theorem | Working status | Required paper treatment |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Claim 20.1.** The seeded morphism ledger verifies its internal invariants. | receipt/replay claim | promote auditability, not neighboring mathematical closure |
| **Claim 20.2.** The ledger contains a populated object/edge/terminal summary | receipt/replay claim | promote auditability, not neighboring mathematical closure |
| **Claim 20.3.** Ledger reachability preserves status distinctions: | receipt/replay claim | promote auditability, not neighboring mathematical closure |
| **Claim 20.4.** The transport layer contains four rows, two demonstrated and | internal formal claim | keep proof-local and preserve falsifier boundary |
| **Claim 20.5.** The contributions registry accepts a durable row only after a | internal formal claim | keep proof-local and preserve falsifier boundary |

### Evidence and Receipt Detail

The receipt surface should be discussed in prose, not only listed. Passing receipts make the paper replayable; failed, partial, or missing checks become local boundaries.
- `layer2_synthesis_ledger_receipt.json`: status=pass; checks=8/8.
- `solution_ledger_affirmed_receipt.json`: status=pass; checks=5/5.
Verifier files are the strongest executable surface. The paper should name the verifier next to any claim it supports.
- `verify_layer2_synthesis_ledger.py` should be mapped to the claim or obligation it checks.
- `verify_solution_ledger_affirmed.py` should be mapped to the claim or obligation it checks.

### Obligation Workups

**20.1.** | 20.1 | Preserve `unknown` reachability as open (do not promote to solved) | Ongoing guard |

- **Status reading:** guard must sit beside the claim it limits.
- **Springboard lane:** `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20`.
- **Paper-local consequence:** Rewrite surrounding prose so the guard is visible at the point where a reader might otherwise infer a stronger claim.
- **Rewrite requirement:** place the guard immediately after the strongest nearby claim, where a reader would otherwise overgeneralize.
- **Upward effect:** Papers in the lane must preserve the `layer-2 synthesis ledger and reachability status surface` boundary before this obligation can strengthen the source paper.

**20.2.** | 20.2 | Preserve forbidden rows (do not discard) | Ongoing guard |

- **Status reading:** guard must sit beside the claim it limits.
- **Springboard lane:** `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20`.
- **Paper-local consequence:** Rewrite surrounding prose so the guard is visible at the point where a reader might otherwise infer a stronger claim.
- **Rewrite requirement:** place the guard immediately after the strongest nearby claim, where a reader would otherwise overgeneralize.
- **Upward effect:** Papers in the lane must preserve the `layer-2 synthesis ledger and reachability status surface` boundary before this obligation can strengthen the source paper.

**20.3.** | 20.3 | Expose aggregate ledger tooling across all 32 papers | Engineering / CQE-06 |

- **Status reading:** strengthenable after receipt path and replay language are explicit.
- **Springboard lane:** `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20`.
- **Paper-local consequence:** Strengthen receipt/path language and ensure any downstream theorem depends on replayable receipts rather than assumed file layout.
- **Rewrite requirement:** use the item to strengthen auditability, not to promote mathematical or physical scope beyond the receipt.
- **Upward effect:** Papers in the lane must preserve the `layer-2 synthesis ledger and reachability status surface` boundary before this obligation can strengthen the source paper.

### Cross-Paper Inheritance

The springboard lane means this paper cannot be revised in isolation. The upstream papers in the lane must preserve the following inherited roles before the local claim can be strengthened:

- Paper 09: finite Hamiltonian-window substrate and receipt-preserving temporal readout.
- Paper 10: master receipt, replay boundary, and open-lift visibility layer.
- Paper 11: theory-admission gate and boundary classifier.
- Paper 12: cellular-automaton prediction surface and Rule 30 scope boundary.
- Paper 13: Standard-Model quark-face transport and calibration boundary.
- Paper 14: GR boundary-repair curvature map and physical-curvature guard.
- Paper 15: QFT/Higgs mass-residue carrier and measured-mass calibration guard.
- Paper 16: continuum-edge residual layer and finite-window-to-limit boundary.
- Paper 17: E6/E8 correction tower and exceptional-lattice lift surface.
- Paper 18: VOA/Moonshine representation route and identification guard.
- Paper 19: observer face-selection and physical-observer boundary.
- Paper 20: layer-2 synthesis ledger and reachability status surface.

### Publication-Grade Rewrite Targets

For the next manual/editorial pass, expand the paper body around these targets:

1. Put the strongest closed theorem in the opening synthesis, then immediately state the largest thing it does not prove.
2. Move every calibration, physical-identification, and external-validation claim into a guarded paragraph with its required witness named.
3. Place verifier and receipt names beside the exact claims they support.
4. Preserve open lifts as first-class obligations rather than treating them as editorial TODOs.


## Canonical Formal Spine

## Abstract

This paper defines the Layer-2 synthesis ledger: the suite-level accounting
surface that aggregates solved, open, failed, forbidden, and transported rows
without changing their source-paper status. The closed result is ledger
behavior. The seed ledger verifies, the rank-24 terminal registry contains
twenty-four forms, reachability distinguishes `yes_with_template_glue`, `no`,
and `unknown`, the transport-obligation verifier returns
`pass_with_open_lifts`, and the contributions registry admits rows only through
a named validator.

The paper does not re-prove any source-paper claim. Aggregation is accounting,
not automatic closure.

## Claims

**Claim 20.1.** The seeded morphism ledger verifies its internal invariants.

**Claim 20.2.** The ledger contains a populated object/edge/terminal summary
with twenty-four registered terminal forms.

**Claim 20.3.** Ledger reachability preserves status distinctions:
`yes_with_template_glue`, `no`, and `unknown`.

**Claim 20.4.** The transport layer contains four rows, two demonstrated and
two open lifts, with verdict `pass_with_open_lifts`.

**Claim 20.5.** The contributions registry accepts a durable row only after a
named validator accepts it, and records rejected proposals.

## Definitions

A **ledger row** is a typed record carrying a source, target, status,
classification, witness, and proof boundary.

A **synthesis ledger** is the suite-level collection of those rows.

A **transported row** is useful but not closed; it carries its open boundary
with the row.

A **forbidden row** is a retained obstruction, not discarded data.

An **unknown row** is an obligation to seed, refute, or prove a path.

## Theorem 20

The Layer-2 synthesis ledger is a verified accounting surface:

```text
source receipt -> ledger row -> preserved status -> aggregate report
```

and no aggregate row may be promoted beyond its source evidence.

## Proof

The verifier builds a fresh seed ledger and runs `Ledger.verify()`. The result
is `status=pass`, proving Claim 20.1.

The ledger summary contains populated object, vector, edge, terminal,
discriminant, and obstruction tables. It reports twenty-four terminal forms.
This proves Claim 20.2.

The verifier checks three reachability cases. `A1 -> Niemeier:A1^24` returns
`yes_with_template_glue`; `G2 -> Niemeier:Leech` returns `no`; an unseeded
source returns `unknown`. These are different ledger states and are not
collapsed into one verdict. This proves Claim 20.3.

The transport verifier reports four rows, two demonstrated rows, two open
lifts, and `all_lifts_demonstrated=false`. This proves Claim 20.4 and keeps
open lifts visible.

The registry probe registers a validator that requires a classification field.
A valid proposal is accepted and can be looked up; a bare assertion is rejected
with a rationale. This proves Claim 20.5.

Together these claims prove the theorem.

## Receipt

Promoted verifier:

```text
production/formal-papers/CQE-paper-20/verify_layer2_synthesis_ledger.py
```

Receipt:

```text
production/formal-papers/CQE-paper-20/layer2_synthesis_ledger_receipt.json
```

Closed layers:

```text
seed ledger verifies
ledger summary tables are populated
24 terminal forms are registered
can_close distinguishes yes_with_template_glue, no, and unknown
transport obligations pass with two demonstrated and two open-lift rows
contributions registry accepts validated rows and records rejected rows
```

Open layers:

```text
source-paper claims are not re-proved by aggregation
unknown reachability rows remain obligations
forbidden rows remain recorded obstructions
open transport lifts remain open until their source verifiers close them
```

## Falsifiers

The paper fails if `Ledger.verify()` fails.

It fails if `unknown` reachability is treated as solved.

It fails if a forbidden row is discarded.

It fails if `pass_with_open_lifts` is promoted to `pass`.

It fails if a contribution enters without validator acceptance.

## Role in the Suite

Papers 17, 18, and 19 export verified rows and open residues. Paper 20 is the
ledger that keeps those rows visible: solved where solved, open where open,
forbidden where forbidden, and transported where transported.

## Conclusion

Paper 20 closes the suite's aggregation discipline. It makes the corpus easier
to audit by refusing to let aggregation become promotion.

## Rework Integration Notes

- Keep the claim-strength tags attached to each theorem or bridge.
- Import companion variant language only when it strengthens exposition without
  promoting an open bridge.
- Treat every obligation row as a routed next-need: verifier, witness, adapter,
  calibration, documentation pass, or explicit guard.
- If a CAM/GLM row proposes `partially_closed`, update the paper body and
  obligation audit together; do not silently mark it closed.
## Upward Rework Intake

Downstream obligations now spring back through this paper. Rework this paper's definitions, receipts, guards, and claim-strength language before carrying the lane upward.

### Reasoned Claim Pressure

- Receipt-closed items may strengthen replayability and audit language, but they do not close unrelated transport, physical, or cold-start mathematical obligations.
- All physical or unit-bearing readings must pass through an external calibration gate before appearing as more than conditional interface language.
- Transport, exceptional algebra, lattice, and Moonshine routes must be graded by witness status instead of narrated as completed bridges.
- Engineering and adapter gaps should be promoted to work items, not used as theorem premises.
- Guard obligations must appear next to the claims they constrain, so the reader cannot miss the boundary.
