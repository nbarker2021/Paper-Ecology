## Virtuous Synthesis

This paper defines continuum edge residuals as local window receipts. The
closed result is local: every chart state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state
in at most three `S3` steps, the edge residue is exactly the state condition
`C=1, R=0`, and power-of-ten windows provide a practical way to sample the
boundary between resolved interior and newly exposed depth. The global
continuum limit is not closed here. The collapse of the propagating correction
sum from `O(N)` to `O(log N)` remains the McKay-Thompson parity obligation.

This version treats the formal paper as the proof spine, the companion variants as interface contracts, and the CAM/GLM rows as status-bearing crystal data. The paper's open obligations are not deleted; they are the next work items required before stronger claims can be promoted.

## Obligation Springboard Lanes

Obligations return to the earliest paper they can affect, then rework upward through each paper in the lane before the local claim is promoted.

### Local Claim Pressure

- Partial CAM/GLM closures should be imported as bounded progress: name the verifier, state the portion advanced, and keep the residual claim visible.

### Local Lane Table

| Obligation | Return start | Upward lane | Rework instruction |
|------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| `16.1` | `09` | `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16` | Leave the obligation live and convert it into the next verifier, witness, adapter, or documentation action. |
| `16.2` | `09` | `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16` | Promote only the bounded or verifier-backed portion; leave the unbounded claim as an explicit obligation with the verifier named. |
| `16.3` | `09` | `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16` | Leave the obligation live and convert it into the next verifier, witness, adapter, or documentation action. |

## Detailed Expansion Pass

### Paper-Level Thesis

Paper 16 functions as the suite's continuum-edge residual layer and finite-window-to-limit boundary. Its virtuous version should therefore make three layers visible at once: the formal claim that is actually proved, the receipt or verifier evidence that lets the claim be replayed, and the explicit boundary that prevents the reader from promoting an open lift into a closed theorem.

The companion variants are used as exposition and interface contracts. They may contribute terminology, examples, and downstream preconditions, but the canonical formal paper remains the proof spine.

### Claim Status Ledger

| Claim/Theorem | Working status | Required paper treatment |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Claim 16.1.** Every local chart state closes to a Lie-conjugate rest state in | bounded or engineering-backed | name verifier-backed portion and keep residual open |
| **Claim 16.2.** There are exactly four Lie-conjugate rest states. | bounded or engineering-backed | name verifier-backed portion and keep residual open |
| **Claim 16.3.** Edge residue is exactly `C AND NOT R`, so it fires only at | bounded or engineering-backed | name verifier-backed portion and keep residual open |
| **Claim 16.4.** Power-of-ten windows are valid local receipt windows. | receipt/replay claim | promote auditability, not neighboring mathematical closure |
| **Claim 16.5.** Local/oracle nth-bit checks pass with correction included, but | readout architecture unless cold proof is named | separate cached/enumerated readout from cold extraction |

### Evidence and Receipt Detail

The receipt surface should be discussed in prose, not only listed. Passing receipts make the paper replayable; failed, partial, or missing checks become local boundaries.
- `alpha_squared_invariant_receipt.json`: status=True; checks=5/5.
- `continuum_edge_residuals_receipt.json`: status=pass; checks=7/7.
Verifier files are the strongest executable surface. The paper should name the verifier next to any claim it supports.
- `verify_continuum_edge_residuals.py` should be mapped to the claim or obligation it checks.
- `verify_glm_alpha_squared_invariant.py` should be mapped to the claim or obligation it checks.

### Obligation Workups

**16.1.** | 16.1 | Global continuum limit | Later physics paper |

- **Status reading:** open next-need.
- **Springboard lane:** `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`.
- **Paper-local consequence:** Leave the obligation live and convert it into the next verifier, witness, adapter, or documentation action.
- **Rewrite requirement:** leave the item live as the next verifier, witness, adapter, calibration, or documentation pass.
- **Upward effect:** Papers in the lane must preserve the `continuum-edge residual layer and finite-window-to-limit boundary` boundary before this obligation can strengthen the source paper.

**16.2.** | 16.2 | Collapse of propagating correction sum from O(N) to O(log N) (McKay-Thompson parity O2′) | Cross-cutting / CQE-17 |

- **Status reading:** partially closed by bounded verifier evidence.
- **Springboard lane:** `09 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`.
- **Paper-local consequence:** Promote only the bounded or verifier-backed portion; leave the unbounded claim as an explicit obligation with the verifier named.
- **Saved evidence to import:** `GLM-F6-YM-EXT02` via `verify_glm_alpha_squared_invariant.py` (partially_closed).
- **Rewrite requirement:** add a bounded-progress sentence naming the verifier and a residual-open sentence naming the part not yet closed.
- **Upward effect:** Papers in the lane must preserve the `continuum-edge residual layer and finite-window-to-limit boundary` boundary before this obligation can strengthen the source paper.

**16.3.** | 16.3 | Power-of-ten windows as methodology, not completed limit | Documentation cleanup |

### Cross-Paper Inheritance

The springboard lane means this paper cannot be revised in isolation. The upstream papers in the lane must preserve the following inherited roles before the local claim can be strengthened:

- Paper 09: finite Hamiltonian-window substrate and receipt-preserving temporal readout.
- Paper 10: master receipt, replay boundary, and open-lift visibility layer.
- Paper 11: theory-admission gate and boundary classifier.
- Paper 12: cellular-automaton prediction surface and Rule 30 scope boundary.
- Paper 13: Standard-Model quark-face transport and calibration boundary.
- Paper 14: GR boundary-repair curvature map and physical-curvature guard.
- Paper 15: QFT/Higgs mass-residue carrier and measured-mass calibration guard.
- Paper 16: continuum-edge residual layer and finite-window-to-limit boundary.

### Publication-Grade Rewrite Targets

For the next manual/editorial pass, expand the paper body around these targets:

1. Put the strongest closed theorem in the opening synthesis, then immediately state the largest thing it does not prove.
2. Move every calibration, physical-identification, and external-validation claim into a guarded paragraph with its required witness named.
3. Place verifier and receipt names beside the exact claims they support.
4. Preserve open lifts as first-class obligations rather than treating them as editorial TODOs.


## Canonical Formal Spine

## Abstract

This paper defines continuum edge residuals as local window receipts. The
closed result is local: every chart state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state
in at most three `S3` steps, the edge residue is exactly the state condition
`C=1, R=0`, and power-of-ten windows provide a practical way to sample the
boundary between resolved interior and newly exposed depth. The global
continuum limit is not closed here. The collapse of the propagating correction
sum from `O(N)` to `O(log N)` remains the McKay-Thompson parity obligation.

## Claims

**Claim 16.1.** Every local chart state closes to a Lie-conjugate rest state in
at most three `S3` transposition steps.

**Claim 16.2.** There are exactly four Lie-conjugate rest states.

**Claim 16.3.** Edge residue is exactly `C AND NOT R`, so it fires only at
`(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`.

**Claim 16.4.** Power-of-ten windows are valid local receipt windows.

**Claim 16.5.** Local/oracle nth-bit checks pass with correction included, but
the global correction collapse remains open.

## Definitions

A **rollout** is the local process of reading a state until it reaches rest.

A **Lie-conjugate rest state** is an `L=R` chart state.

An **edge residual** is a carry in flight at a window boundary:

```text
edge_residue(L,C,R) = C AND NOT R
```

A **power-of-ten window** is a practical aperture at depths `10`, `100`,
`1000`, and so on. It is a receipt window, not a continuum proof.

## Theorem 16

Continuum edge residuals are locally well-defined window receipts:

```text
local state -> <=3-step rest closure -> edge_residue = C AND NOT R
```

and every global continuum claim remains an obligation until the propagating
correction sum is closed.

## Proof

The centroid verifier checks all eight chart states and reports local closure.
Every state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state in at most three `S3` steps.
This proves Claim 16.1.

The rest states are the four states satisfying `L=R`. The verifier reports the
count as `4`. This proves Claim 16.2.

The edge-residue formula is `C AND NOT R`. Exhausting all eight states gives
exactly `(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`. This proves Claim 16.3.

The verifier samples windows at `10`, `100`, and `1000`. For each window it
records the selected local state, edge-residue value, anneal step count, and
final rest state. Each sampled window closes locally. This proves Claim 16.4 as
a local receipt statement.

The nth-bit layer passes with local/oracle correction included, but the receipt
names McKay-Thompson correction parity as open. Therefore the local edge
residual is admitted while global continuum collapse is not. This proves Claim
16.5.

Together these claims prove the theorem.

## Receipt

Promoted verifier:

```text
production/formal-papers/CQE-paper-16/verify_continuum_edge_residuals.py
```

Receipt:

```text
production/formal-papers/CQE-paper-16/continuum_edge_residuals_receipt.json
```

Closed layers:

```text
every local chart state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state in <=3 S3 steps
there are four Lie-conjugate rest states
edge residue is exactly C and not R
sample decade windows carry local receipts
local/oracle nth-bit layer passes with correction included
```

Open layers:

```text
global continuum closure
O(N) to O(log N) propagating-correction collapse
closed McKay-Thompson correction parity
claim that adding digits terminates continuum depth
```

## Falsifiers

The paper fails if any local chart state needs more than three anneal steps.

It fails if edge residue fires outside `C=1, R=0`.

It fails if power-of-ten windows are treated as a completed continuum limit.

It fails if the McKay-Thompson parity obligation is hidden.

## Role in the Suite

Paper 15 exports a residue carrier. Paper 16 turns that carrier into a windowed
edge reading. Paper 17 may use the windowed residual as an input to the
error-correction tower only by carrying the open global-collapse boundary.

## Conclusion

Paper 16 closes the local edge-residual instrument. It does not close the
continuum limit. That distinction lets later papers use powers of ten as
inspectable windows while preserving the deeper obligation.

## Rework Integration Notes

- Keep the claim-strength tags attached to each theorem or bridge.
- Import companion variant language only when it strengthens exposition without
  promoting an open bridge.
- Treat every obligation row as a routed next-need: verifier, witness, adapter,
  calibration, documentation pass, or explicit guard.
- If a CAM/GLM row proposes `partially_closed`, update the paper body and
  obligation audit together; do not silently mark it closed.
## Upward Rework Intake

Downstream obligations now spring back through this paper. Rework this paper's definitions, receipts, guards, and claim-strength language before carrying the lane upward.

### Reasoned Claim Pressure

- Receipt-closed items may strengthen replayability and audit language, but they do not close unrelated transport, physical, or cold-start mathematical obligations.
- Partial CAM/GLM closures should be imported as bounded progress: name the verifier, state the portion advanced, and keep the residual claim visible.
- All physical or unit-bearing readings must pass through an external calibration gate before appearing as more than conditional interface language.
- Transport, exceptional algebra, lattice, and Moonshine routes must be graded by witness status instead of narrated as completed bridges.
- Engineering and adapter gaps should be promoted to work items, not used as theorem premises.
- Guard obligations must appear next to the claims they constrain, so the reader cannot miss the boundary.
